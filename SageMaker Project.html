/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<pre>Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I&#39;m offended that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I&#39;ve seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. There is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the &#34;adventures of dickman&#34; scene was sophomoric at best.. Color me p***ed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. NEVER WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. That&#39;s saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. It&#39;s many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably. Crash and burn....

<pre>[&#39;In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tough landlord Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) establish stringent rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors. Meanwhile he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After the death of Simone, Trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird &#34;Le Locataire&#34; is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion. The story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment, and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable. The performances are awesome and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;O Inquilino&#34; (&#34;The Tenant&#34;)&#39;,
 &#39;Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister, she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them. VCR\&#39;S had just became a household item and we didn\&#39;t have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie I don\&#39;t have and I knew this movie looked familiar. I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought. She had sold it years ago in a yard sale I am guessing - who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\&#39;t recall anything at all about it and I watched it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. I am not sure how I felt about it as a kid but I am sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I\&#39;d watch and enjoy anything back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a horror freak, but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it &#34;good&#34; and this one fell very short. It was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types. What death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you\&#39;re lucky you get that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is good and I have seen a few with similar plots, so I think this one should be buried and forgotten. Don\&#39;t watch this people unless you\&#39;re hard up.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t believe we don&#39;t have that 70&#39;s show anymore. I have all 8 seasons of that 70&#39;s show!! I absolutely Love It!! I lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before I go to sleep. At the end of a long busy day it&#39;s nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep. I was so sad they took the show off air... at least we still have the re-runs!! I am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion...Like maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and Eric get married!!!! Wouldn&#39;t that be awesome!!! It would be even better if they would continue it for several years!!&#34;,
 &#39;After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast &amp; furious series. So, I already expected it to have a lacking storyline, but at least this time it won\&#39;t be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast &amp; Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen (I\&#39;m being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). Not only was the storyline non-existent, but the action was crap too. I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his &#34;girls&#34; (an Imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn\&#39;t take it anymore. So, I only got to see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I had ever walked out on. Afterwards, I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. You\&#39;re better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.&#39;,
 &#34;This is the first 10 out of 10 that I&#39;ve given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there isn&#39;t any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn&#39;t try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there&#39;s no forced romance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!&#34;,
 &#34;I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache. The pacing was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why, oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit &#39;consumer approval&#39;. Agamemnon didn&#39;t die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#39;t even start me on the &#39;lack&#39; of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn&#39;t even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O&#39; Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn&#39;t enough to save this awful movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can anybody tell me where the £200 million budget went? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed it hurts.&#34;,
 &#39;Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly\&#39;s clichéd, patchy, overwrought screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story... &#34;sort of&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this rubbish is that there isn\&#39;t much of a story at all and Scott\&#39;s extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey\&#39;s chaotic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just don\&#39;t care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as an obnoxious, cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect. She punches people she doesn\&#39;t like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she isn\&#39;t the least bit real and Knightly isn\&#39;t the least bit convincing, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is boring. It\&#39;s loud, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I\&#39;ve heard in a long time. The final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of Scott\&#39;s &#34;True Romance&#34; climax with Domino\&#39;s gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise! surprise! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the &#34;narrative&#34; progresses. Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t be fooled by this film\&#39;s multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.&#39;,
 &#34;Abhay Deol&#39;s second film, written by Imtiaz Ali, maiden directorial effort by Shivam Nair. Soha probably has her first (?) meaty role as Megha, a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the Delhi marriage registrar&#39;s office for her boyfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi) to meet her. She waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by Ankush (Abhay Deol). They spend many days together as he extricates her from one distressing situation after another and finally falls in love with her. Then the boyfriend returns! Aage pardey par dekhiye! Sound familiar? This is yet another adaptation of Dostoyevsky&#39;s White Nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from Le Notti Bianchi (very tiny though - Ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead!). But this is an earthier and more realistic (duh) adaptation than the much hyped and overblown Saawariya. I wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing Saawariya like crazy a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Delhi settings are wonderful - there is the obligatory run through old Delhi, shots of Jama Masjid from a roof top, Connaught Circus, streets with rickshaws (What? How?). The colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I see of Abhay the more I like this young man. In this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman. Soha looks beautiful, and when she smiles she fits the role, but I found her unconvincing in the more serious moments. I am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress, or maybe she will blossom late like the brother. The music by Himesh Reshammiya is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs, they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them. The supporting cast is excellent and I give this White Nights adaptation a thumbs up. BTW - the fact that I love Abhay Deol&#39;s cute dimples has NOTHING to do with my rating.&#34;,
 &#34;If you hate redneck accents, you&#39;ll hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, a has been trying to be a redneck. I really can&#39;t stand redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good in Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can this movie get? The storyline was stupid. I&#39;m usually not this judgemental of movies, but I couldn&#39;t stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom found this movie for $5.95 at Wal Mart...figures...I think I&#39;ll wrap it up and give it to my Grandma for Christmas. It could just be that I can&#39;t stand redneck accents usually, or that I can&#39;t stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze wasn&#39;t in it. I didn&#39;t laugh once in the movie. I laugh at anything stupid usually. If they had shown someones fingers getting smashed, I might have laughed. people&#39;s fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie is another horror anthology. It is rather good, but it could have used a bit more. I compare it to &#34;Doctor Terror\&#39;s House of Horrors&#34;, though in this one the title fits. It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house. The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in. He creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house. This one is sort of predictable, but it does throw a few twists in the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the heck it is going. This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch. This guy buys the house, but it is not the house that takes center stage, but a rather strange wax museum. The third story starts out rather good and features Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter. The problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough. It drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion. Then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I don\&#39;t think it really explained Cushing\&#39;s story much at all. I think they needed a bit more back story for that one. All in all though it was an interesting set of stories.&#39;,
 &#34;This &#39;Movie&#39; has to be the biggest pile of steaming C*^p I have ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seen, What more can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is NOTHING to save this &#39;movie&#39; and I pray that they NEVER even talk about making a sequel. If you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth. Movies like Men in Black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this &#39;Comedy&#39; but have TOTALLY failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).&#34;,
 &#39;Spoilers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the one line summary says it all. Melville´s &#34;Le samurai&#34; is the original and there are elements of &#34;Leon&#34;. And they are better - much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the &#34;Samurai&#34; Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs (with so much suspense in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog. But I guess Jarmusch liked &#34;Leon&#34; very much or even &#34;Desperado&#34; by Rodriguez. So he added this, too. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in &#34;Leon&#34;)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the unique, the original thought in this movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can´t see the point in making carbon (celluloid) copies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor&#39;,
 &#34;At one end of the Eighties Warren Beatty created and starred in the literate epic Reds about the founding of the Soviet Union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical John Reed. It was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. At the end of the decade Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. In this film Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city&#39;s top mobster Big Boy Caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition. The film opens with him rubbing out Lips Manlis&#39;s henchmen in a Valentine Massacre style shooting and then Lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat. But Caprice&#39;s moves are making him a target for Tracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple Caprice himself. Will our hero sort out this thicket of crime?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author Chester Gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham, you&#39;ve got to love this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but any of these guys could have, it&#39;s only that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time. Only Beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. Dick Tracy won Oscars for Best Art&amp;Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact he was even able to get somebody like Sondheim to write a score for this film only shows Sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer Breathless Mahoney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this film, Dick Tracy movies were consigned to the B pictures and worse as Saturday afternoon serials. The only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for Armed Forces Radio during World War II that got to vinyl. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, and the Andrews Sisters? Try and find a recording of that gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then Warren Beatty&#39;s classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely.&#34;,
 &#39;After eight Moto films the series had run its course, as this last entry demonstrates. Peter Lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of Moto, and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a &#34;funny&#34; British sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here.&#39;,
 &#39;I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and directing. How can a movie as this one ever be made. The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a jumping board into a career. Please make sure that you\&#39;ll not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and directing awful. There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the &#34;LOW 10&#34;. Another example would be &#34;Dracula 3000&#34;. People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case I would watch it even another 10 (or at least one more time).&#39;,
 &#39;This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isn\&#39;t really made very clear. The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they\&#39;re herded around outside in little yellow jackets. The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. This is a world of relentless industrialization. It\&#39;s a relief at least to know these soulless images aren\&#39;t going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalter\&#39;s gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, \&#39;Our Daily Bread.\&#39; \&#39;Manufactured Landscapes\&#39; contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. Some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer Sebastião Salgado. But this photographer isn\&#39;t as interested in seeing people up close. His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this happens in China, of course, though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in Bangladesh. It is backed up by music in a New Age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive. There are a good many stills of the photographer\&#39;s work--or were some of them made by the film crew? It isn\&#39;t made clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Burtynsky is the name of the photographer. We see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow. The irony is that Burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted, and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring. He admits himself that he takes no political stand. When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film\&#39;s cinematographer Peter Mettler, Burtynsky\&#39;s work almost amounts to a kind of glorification, and hence falsification. But he is showing us places that, if we look closely, reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logically, but not entirely fortunately, it is Burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites. Burtynsky\&#39;s &#34;epiphanies&#34; may have inspired his decades of fine work, but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we\&#39;re changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil, which will run out; that China has come into the game of massive industrialization late, and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel. The interest of \&#39;Manufactured Landscapes\&#39; would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it. The reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of Burtynsky\&#39;s work and the raw materials, the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast, awesome, daunting, and rather horrifying industrialization of modern China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title \&#39;Manufactured Landscapes\&#39; feels insufficiently developed. It even seems a misnomer. New landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than &#34;manufactured.&#34; \&#39;Landscapes of Waste\&#39; or \&#39;Wasted Landscapes\&#39; might be better titles. There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions.&#39;,
 &#39;The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, perhaps then you *MIGHT* enjoy this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted needlessly. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re-union was just too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the face of the *GENERAL* audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it at your own peril. At least I know I have been scarred for life :(&#39;,
 &#39;By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the story was &#34;moved outside,&#34; so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second &amp; Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I\&#39;m confused! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I\&#39;ve now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and wouldn\&#39;t mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories. If you want to see a musical which includes a great &#34;cattle call&#34; audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, see it on stage.&#39;,
 &#39;Disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn\&#39;t make at least two sequels about. And this one was no exception to the people at Disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, although I did not pay to view it, I feel cheapened by watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ariel is grown up now and had a daughter. Yet doesn\&#39;t allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased sea-witch. So here we go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daughter is tricked (of course) and helps the sea-witch. After a not-so-glorious battle, she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony. Yawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to view here. Go back to your lives. &#34;D-&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;TCM is keeping me awake all the time... they keep coming up with films Ive never heard of ... Senso.... now Ossessione... a very early film by Visconti!!... wow... the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice...brilliant!! beautifully acted and directed ...Never heard of either leads who were excellent, Clara Calamai,as Giovanna, and especially, Massimo Girotti as Gino... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943!!! His look was ahead of its time...many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him... he should have been a major world wide star!! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson/Jessica Lange version and less glossier than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remember that white outfit ? who can forget.... This Italian version is different ..more realistic and with a very different ending... see it watch it...Im going to buy it !!&#39;,
 &#39;The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies. It is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. The casting couldn\&#39;t have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genies. And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying &#34;evilness&#34; a few years later in &#34;Casablanca.&#34; And Korda teamed up,I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in &#34;The Four Feathers&#34;....great film-making!&#39;,
 &#34;This will be a different kind of review. I&#39;ve seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I&#39;d seen by Ashley Judd and she was great and I&#39;ve enjoyed every other thing I&#39;ve seen her in. Sundance&#39;s reaction made an impression on me too, as did the director, Victor Nunez, who has directed and written several movies about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I&#39;ve seen nothing with which to compare it. The plot speaks less to me than the surroundings. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.&#34;,
 &#39;Horror Gods Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any Genre-lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little Sci-Fi/Horror gem. While Lambert Hillyer\&#39;s &#34;The Invisible Ray&#34; of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring Karloff (&#34;Frankenstein, &#34;Bride Of Frankenstein&#34;, &#34;The Mummy&#34;,...) or Lugosi (&#34;White Zombie&#34;, &#34;Island Of The Lost Souls&#34;, &#34;Dracula&#34;,...), or both (&#34;The Black Cat&#34;, &#34;The Raven&#34;,...), this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. Compared to other Universal Horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. Karloff and Lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. Stunned by Rukh\&#39;s invention, the celebrated French scientist Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. In Africa, Rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... It is somewhat odd that Karloff, who was in fact British, plays a Hungarian scientist here while Lugosi, who was Hungarian, plays a French Scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. As far as I am concerned, these two Horror Deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and I am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the Horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. By the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that Lugosi was actually taller than Karloff. Frances Drake makes a very good female lead in her role of Dr Rukh\&#39;s beautiful young wife. The rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. Other than the casting of Karloff and Lugosi, the film\&#39;s greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. My main complaint is that I would have wished for more screen time for Lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. He is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. Otherwise, &#34;The Invisible Ray&#34; is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic Horror/Sci-Fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow Lugosi/Karloff fans.&#39;,
 &#39;This film is terrible. Every line is stolen from 8MM (the Italian dubbed version, at least). If you like trash... real trash, give it a try; but beware: this ain\&#39;t the &#34;so bad it\&#39;s good&#34; kind of flick. In its cheapness, it may really look like a porno but, believe me, if you\&#39;re looking for &#34;snuff&#34;, s &amp; m, hardcore, softcore... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in store! I\&#39;m telling you this, \&#39;cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, plot, dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are the ones they stolen from Joel Schumacher\&#39;s 8MM!) will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the &#34;happy ending&#34; is absolutely revolting! I\&#39;ll give it one star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after &#34;the eyes of the victim&#34; monologue (stolen from 8MM as well) and a half for mom &amp; daughter\&#39;s sexy bodies (that didn\&#39;t manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett\&#39;s hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. It is awful. Almost everything fails. First off, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to mangle ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the CASTING!!! They are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn\&#39;t take your eyes off of them. But this cast just gets by dancing, does a &#34;nice&#34; job singing but none of them spark one bit. In fact, look up the cast on IMDb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. A total strike-out! (But even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was).&#39;,
 &#39;But if you like the muppets I defy you to dislike this one. Basically the same plot regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx. A lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I happened to have enjoyed it greatly. Fun to watch with your kids.&#39;,
 &#39;Usually, I know after the first minute of a movie if I will hate it or adore it... but now, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The start was great; the &#34;this is based on a true story&#34; and blah blah blah thing was funny. After, the cartoons and the description of the guys\&#39; life with pictures made me think I had made the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, seeing the hilarious fake look of Toronto was cool. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie... which afterwards looked like an eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that\&#39;s just me not understanding English Canadian humour (that\&#39;s possible, English Canadians also do not always understand Quebecois humour), but hey... there was enough stuff in that for a short movie, *nothing* more. Maybe that could be a meaning for the title? Anyway, almost everything was filling, and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, the &#34;making of&#34; was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; that\&#39;s why I rented the movie, being interested in the &#34;annoying people disappearance&#34; thing. But yet, I did not know the whole universe would vanish, and with it even a point to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are English Canadian, it seems you could appreciate the local humour, considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8. Otherwise, just think twice before losing your precious time...&#39;,
 &#34;To anyone who might think this show isn&#39;t for them, please give it a try. Network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people. This show is a return to family oriented TV where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are about, and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today, and he is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham, and Kirsten Storms round out the main cast, and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen. Hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter&#39;s character) learn and grow.&#34;,
 &#39;Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It\&#39;s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don\&#39;t know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood &#34;idjits&#34; wouldn\&#39;t have been in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don\&#39;t mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you\&#39;re going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.&#39;,
 &#39;I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling &#34;Gentleman Jim&#34; the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick &#34;Somebody Up There Likes Me.&#34; That movie might be number 1, but &#34;Gentleman Jim&#34; is a close number 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie doesn\&#39;t just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more &#34;gentlemanly&#34; days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Gentleman Jim&#34; is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the &#34;Gentleman&#34; Jim who really isn\&#39;t a &#34;gentleman&#34; at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of &#34;Gentleman Jim&#34; the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT &#34;I can lick any man in the world&#34; of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch &#34;Raging Bull&#34; instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But &#34;Gentleman Jim&#34; is a lot more fun.&#39;,
 &#39;There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award. Well, it does not deserve an audience as well. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least. Every frame, you feel you are getting the &#34;full picture&#34;, its like someone is &#34;cropping your view&#34; from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I will be honest, I could not bear to watch the entire movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.&#39;,
 &#39;No, I\&#39;m not joking around. If you ever, EVER, have the chance to see this movie see it. If you need chop off your arm to see it, see it. It\&#39;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty Drives The Bus is unlike any film you\&#39;ve ever seen. It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art. While it contains poor shots, idiotic characters, bad dialogue, strange acting, and cinematography that belongs on public access in Iowa, it actually succeeds in its goal as a film. It strives to be the dumbest, strangest, most inane movie you\&#39;ve ever seen. And boy does it ever succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things (the filmmakers obviously didn\&#39;t), but really you needn\&#39;t pay too much attention because the entire film\&#39;s plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits. In any event, FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago, which is led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in town, and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except with Jesus in town, a lackey in hell calls off the job, and this angers Satan because, well he doesn\&#39;t like looking like a fool in front of the guy, so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly, but he\&#39;s a devil, so he needs to disguise himself, otherwise, who\&#39;d go on a tour with him right, so he disguises himself as Roger and he gets on the bus, where the driver is never referred to by name, but he is kind of fat, so I guess he\&#39;s Fatty. The bus (and the riders) are on a collision course with wackiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examples of some lunacy: The title repeats on the screen 3 times. I don\&#39;t know why. A character appears on the bus in mid-trip without explanation or introduction, and occassionally sits next to the others, and they look at her like she doesn\&#39;t belong. I don\&#39;t know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange longing glances, that are really the same shots repeated over and over again. I don\&#39;t know why. After Satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes &#34;Satan is going to transform.&#34; I don\&#39;t know why. One character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag, and is referred to by other characters as &#34;the glamorous Bridget.&#34; I don\&#39;t know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was one good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer it was getting my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.&#39;,
 &#39;I took a chance on &#34;Hardcastle and McCormick&#34; by purchasing the first season\&#39;s worth (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was instantly hooked after that. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I am rating it 10 stars here. It is just that good. What I liked about it were the opening and closing themes, and of course Stephen J. Cannell\&#39;s logo at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they worked together to crack each case. I was so hooked that I also purchased the second season as a companion, and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent series on disc, I believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection.&#39;,
 &#39;I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? What was up with the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly amazed. I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.&#39;,
 &#34;I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969. After actually seeing it, however, I&#39;m not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck&#39;s character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck&#39;s character in such a short movie. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him. I think when he looks in the mirror he&#39;s trying to see if it&#39;s really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate. Anyway, this considered an all-time great for a reason.&#34;,
 &#34;A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $1 million provided he or she makes it that far. A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar. Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation that white people can&#39;t dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin. Pay close attention for the nipple slip. This continues on for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess. It&#39;s a game until it&#39;s not a game. The three old coots are in complete control until they&#39;re not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props. They&#39;re dead until they&#39;re not. Even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn&#39;t know what the hell happened. I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckey&#39;s. I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself. Let&#39;s see Gone With the Wind do that! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me. Bane, Get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.&#34;,
 &#39;Tsui Hark\&#39;s visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. Unfortunately the terrible acting by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it\&#39;s that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw this, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I\&#39;ve never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung-fu novels! Without a doubt this is one of the best-looking Chinese historical kung-fu epic ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, Tsui Hark hasn\&#39;t improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn\&#39;t help either). To make it worse, this movie is very badly cast. They decided to use the &#34;hot&#34; popular Hong Kong idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that someday Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of Tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of Zhang...&#39;,
 &#34;Hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences aren&#39;t really interested in what puts protagonists into danger - only that they ARE in danger, and need to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film proves Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when she plainly isn&#39;t. Trevor Howard decides their best course of action is to run for it. And so, the body of the movie has our charismatic pair dodging on and off trains, buses and coaches - jumping across rocks at the top of a waterfall - scrambling across dockyard roofs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All good exciting stuff - but I couldn&#39;t get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary. They should have stayed put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the MacGuffin wasn&#39;t strong enough.&#34;,
 &#39;This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects. Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good movie with a good message.&#39;,
 &#34;Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist, Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework. As might be expected from Luc Besson&#39;s name on the credits as producer, there&#39;s a definite element of &#39;Cinema de look&#39; about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he&#39;s spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything its problem is that he&#39;s trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn&#39;t want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it&#39;s really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film&#39;s central (somewhat metaphysical) con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people&#39;s exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it&#39;s got a lot going for it all the same. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta&#39;s intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?&#34;,
 &#39;The \&#39;80\&#39;s were not very kind to one-time major star Charles Bronson. Starting with 1982\&#39;s &#34;Death Wish II&#34; and ending with this truly gruesome film from \&#39;89, Bronson\&#39;s screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness. &#34;D.W. II&#34; left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson\&#39;s character\&#39;s daughter, (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail). &#34;10 to Midnight&#34; was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeeming about it. Other films like &#34;The Evil that Men Do&#34; and the remaining &#34;Death Wish&#34; films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge. I\&#39;m not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out of showing a weary looking, senior citizen-aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the shoddy craftsmanship (and terrible scripts) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Kinjite&#34; -- the last of these films -- is fairly well-made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness. In this film Bronson: sodomizes a perverse john; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I\&#39;ve thankfully forgotten. Also depicted is the gang-rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, though well-implied).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were people thinking when they made this film? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films? For anyone interested in his best movies, check out most of the films he made in the \&#39;60\&#39;s and \&#39;70\&#39;s like &#34;The Mechanic&#34;, &#34;Death Wish&#34;, &#34;From Noon til 3&#34;, &#34;Once Upon a Time in the West&#34;, &#34;Red Sun&#34;, &#34;The Great Escape&#34;, &#34;The Magnificent Seven&#34;, &#34;Rider on the Rain&#34;, etc., etc....&#39;,
 &#39;Actually, I never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff, but this movie kind of played on that idea. Though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high, it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing. The story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave. So yes, a bit of &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street&#34; plot going on here. Granted Freddy never molested a girl in a car before. There was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy. This one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him. Nothing to gruesome in it as I do not remember all that many gory kills. Quite frankly, the scene I do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band. Nothing great, but a nice time filler.&#39;,
 &#39;As usual, Sean Connery does a great job. Lawrence Fishburn is good, but I have a hard time not seeing him as Ike Turner.&#39;,
 &#39;Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson´s 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should have fired the continuity guy, too: Note how Thomerson´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. Laughably bad, but that´s why we watch these movies, ain´t it? Sequel ´Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys´ is reportedly even worse, if that´s possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0 (of ****)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Stories of the Century&#34; was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the \&#39;54-\&#39;55 television season. It was also the first western TV series to win an Emmy award. Starring veteran western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, the series set Clark and his fellow railroad detective partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as &#34;Jonesy&#34; during the second half)against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860\&#39;s to the early 1900\&#39;s. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch, and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He seemed like an actual western character. One other note. When Matt Clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good early adult western.&#39;,
 &#39;Before Dogma 95: when Lars used movies as art, not just a story. A beautiful painting about love and death. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The color... The music... Just perfect.&#39;,
 &#34;Cut to the chase, this is one of the five worst films that I&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that they didn&#39;t try. There was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there, a good cast, some good acting. I&#39;m not sure where it went wrong, but it went horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story, a lot of overacting by the lead (who probably is much better when restrained), some bad directing and editing. I had enough at about an hour, tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran. There was also an insincerity about it all, being that I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. He was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it. That was bolstered by the pretty 17 year-old girl who was in love with the 30 year-old junkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the frantic nature of the lead was a turn-off enough. There were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was listless and unending (with uneven time lines). The characters were colorful but to no end, which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you&#39;ve just not seen enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip it. I assumed that this was a first-time director who was enamored by his own turds, but he has done this before. I&#39;m puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.&#34;,
 &#39;Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera &#34;direction&#34; needs serious reworking. And no more &#34;hold the camera and run&#34; gimmicks either; it just doesn\&#39;t work. The special effects are unimaginative, there\&#39;s a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you\&#39;re going to rip off an ear, please don\&#39;t let us see the actor\&#39;s real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I\&#39;ve seen some of his other &#34;home movies&#34; (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a &#34;director&#34; will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It\&#39;s one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a film.&#39;,
 &#39;I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren\&#39;s early work. I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Surely, today, this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. It actually became annoying watching Ms. Loren in skin color paint throughout the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then, the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at age 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage. After all, we don\&#39;t see beautiful young people on stage with &#34;old opera singers&#34; back stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers. One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company\&#39;s product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality. The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this film not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this is an opera. Aside from Ms. Sofia Loren none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. Loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry from Illinois&#39;,
 &#39;One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter. The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a &#34;cold case&#34;-style thriller. It is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people dislike any movie that is shot on video. This attitude is very old-style and provincial. It is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem.&#39;,
 &#34;was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie? the character, leon, is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore. some movies can get away with the sexual jokes, and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on. some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie. scary movie was stupid, and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes. the only role, besides leon, that had some humor that followed was will ferrell. the character really was dumb and that was all, the dumb humor was all that had me watching. the movie was ok, and nothing else. i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. the skits last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit, then what is the world coming to? molly shannon had superstar, cheri o&#39;terri had scary movie, but she wasnt a leading role, and will had elf. but that was good, but he did some dumb movie, but i cant remember, and mike myers with wayne&#39;s world. how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals? seen only one guy break through, but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick. but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue, funny or not. this movie is not good, but had some positive humor. what a waste of film and people&#39;s money.

 &#34;Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility. She will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus beneath the vicey exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate, with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with &#39;and then I woke up&#39;. It is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I&#39;ve ever seen, but don&#39;t let any of that put you off.&#34;,
 &#39;This a Casper the Friendly Ghost short from my childhood, and I re-watch it on YouTube (Thank GOD! for You Tube); after that I love this short, and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the short starts off spooky with Frank Gallop\&#39;s haunting narration; until we get to see Casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery, reading. While every ghost rose from the graves to &#34;boo&#34; people, Casper decides to leave in search for a friend. But in trying to make a friend, anyone who sees Casper runs away. Poor Casper sat on a log and weep; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him. Casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub Ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casper and Ferdie\&#39;s relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when Casper is not keeping a close eye on Ferdie while they are playing a game of Hide and Seek. While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter\&#39;s direction and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper. Casper yells to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie\&#39;s body is not moving and asks if he is OK. When Casper sees Ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost &#34;the only friend he ever had in his whole life.&#34; Casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to Casper\&#39;s gravestone. Casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that Ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself. Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek. Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a really good short; though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon.&#39;,
 &#39;I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can\&#39;t act at all. She read her lines very un-naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural. She played her part with great perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS! The story was simple - we\&#39;ve seen it many, many times before. She breaks up, he finds another, she get jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end. There were no surprises at all, one knew that Eva would break up, and that Adam would &#34;hook up&#34; with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra told Adam to go after Eva at the party. She became all serious, which is a side of Petra the viewers hadn\&#39;t seen earlier in the movie, and told him to win Eva\&#39;s heart back, which was really cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides Rosanna Munter, there isn\&#39;t a single actor who gives a memorable performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I don\&#39;t recommend it!&#39;,
 &#34;My god, what&#39;s going on? a Uwe Boll film and positive comments? Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to Boll&#39;s work. I myself, as I have stated in previous Uwe Boll reviews, only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good. I mean..IT MUST HAPPEN ONE DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, Seed is not that day. I don&#39;t quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that Seed is. The thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net.....or so Mr Boll believes. I still can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff.....but can&#39;t understand why Mr Boll thought putting REAL footage in the film would work. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm.....well, I for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film. I DON&#39;T though, find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest. If you were trying to shock me, it didn&#39;t work. It just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films. This sort of context may have worked for films in the 70/80&#39;s (Cannibal Holocaust) but not todays market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like BloodRayne 2. You can just tell that there wasn&#39;t a huge amount of money floating around for production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per usual, Mr Boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of Seed&#39;s victims in the first 25 mins. Each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim. It&#39;s all very boring and tedious. I won&#39;t comment on the toddler scene as it&#39;s laughable and just another cheap &#39;shock&#39; factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch Seed. The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old &#39;I&#39;m not using a steady cam&#39; fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as Seed is caught. This scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it. The cop actually tells Seed he could have shot him. For some un-be-known reason, the cop doesn&#39;t shoot him. Given that Seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults, you&#39;d have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops burying Seed alive (and they know he is alive..why not shoot him in the head????), followed by Seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop&#39;s family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#39;m trying to get across to you all here is that it&#39;s just plain STUPID! It&#39;s not even Hollywood horror stupid....just plain dumb. Uwe Boll can not direct ****. Anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement. Anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again we are treated to a poorly acted, directed, lighted, produced, scripted piece of UB crap.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. Bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didn&#39;t touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess they&#39;re saving those old chestnuts for Dooley&#39;s next outing. Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like Dooley&#39;s prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.&#34;,
 &#39;Actually this movie was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for instance Doug Hutchison (Percy from &#34;The Green Mile&#34;), who plays Bristol. Another well known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from &#34;Scream&#34; and &#34;Three Kings&#34;. The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me, was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like &#34;The Green Mile&#34;, &#34;Indian Runner&#34;, &#34;The Negotiator&#34; or &#34;The Langoliers&#34; he plays a very sympathetic person, and in &#34;Bait&#34; the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated. Overall I thought this was a pretty good little film!&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official &#34;truth&#34; and caught so many &#34;news&#34; agencies with their pants down. This movie, in my view, deserves every price there is in journalism - it\&#39;s objective (yes!), courageous and a real &#34;scoop&#34;. It can do without comment, fake scenes or leading questions - everyone, including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. The filmmakers &#34;only&#34; had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venezuelan elite teaches us &#34;How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy&#34;. It\&#39;s amazing that they lost in the end - so far. From what I know, the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked, they\&#39;re still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. But then, they don\&#39;t have to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the &#34;Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians&#34; scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called &#34;free&#34; (established) media really has become, or has always been, only more so. An important lesson to anyone interested in what &#34;really&#34; goes on in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The famous &#34;objectivity&#34; challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view, or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse &#34;us&#34; - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb, the US secret history of spreading &#34;democracy&#34; around the world or the Iraq war that, according to Johns Hopkins, has killed 1,3 million Iraquis by now, not to mention the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US. And the US is ready &amp; willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, whether there will be any mention of &#34;our&#34; involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot\&#39;s guerrillas in the 80\&#39;s, when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance, if not exposure of fraud.&#39;,
 &#39;Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in &#34;Mrs Brown&#34;. &#34;The Young Victoria&#34; tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria\&#39;s mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria\&#39;s natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold\&#39;s hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV\&#39;s unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford\&#39;s attempt on Victoria\&#39;s life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria\&#39;s accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a &#34;Regency Order&#34;; the Duchess\&#39;s constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a &#34;Danger! Major cliché ahead!&#34; warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in &#34;Moulin Rouge&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for the film\&#39;s success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria\&#39;s Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make &#34;The Young Victoria&#34; a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10&#39;,
 &#39;As a lover of the surreal (in art and film) I was pleased to discover this film on IFC. It is definitely a keeper. Most of the other reviews tell the general plot (not all correct) so I won\&#39;t bother to bore anyone with that. The main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by Ana\&#39;s impending illness, and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so &#34;alone&#34;, and finally with her family, which I believe is still at least a little troubled. It only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy (with a little hint of &#34;coming of age&#34; only because Ana is a pre-teen who &#34;hates boys&#34;). I heartily recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination.&#39;,
 &#39;Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it doesn\&#39;t even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time. I remember the day I first saw this on MST. Sun was shining, looked like a good day. then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard job, fights with rakes, and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images. No plot or story is needed. Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves. An army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say, &#34; He has got some nice red shorts&#34;. Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart. Just when you think it\&#39;s over, wait until the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise that after viewing this film, a good month to regain senses and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.&#39;,
 &#34;Like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine... The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it&#39;s too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes. Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;ve seen Mystery Men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public ( take the imdb vote for instance), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most films, definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and very nearly \&#39;clever\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear\&#39;s limo scene with Ricky Jay is perfect \&#39;spoiled movie star\&#39; and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit the pacing is a little off in places, and visuals are certainly very flash bang, possibly to the detriment of further characterisation, but at the end of the day, this is high concept film making - it\&#39;s about the little moments &#34;What\&#39;s Up Tiger Lily?&#34; - and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing.&#39;,
 &#39;I work with children from 0 \x96 6 years old and they all love the Doodlebops. The Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing. Once they start singing, \&#39;\&#39;We\&#39;re the Doodlebops We\&#39;re the Doodlebops We\&#39;re the Doodlebops Oh yeah Come and join the fun because we\&#39;re laughing and we\&#39;re singing all day&#34; it is almost impossible not to join them in song. The Doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun. Each show is an adventure, the Doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to. The Doodlebops is an refreshing, high action alternative to regular children\&#39;s television programs.&#39;,
 &#34;The 1997 low-key indie dramedy Henry Fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to revisit for a sequel. A rumpled, dissipated drifter (Thomas Jay Ryan) strolls into town. His anarchistic rantings and delusions inspire a nerdy garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems, while Henry half-heartedly tries to boink the guy&#39;s sister (Parker Posey). As the poet prospers, Henry declines. Nothing special about any of the characters or the story. A pitch for Harold and Maude&#39;s Ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Parker Posey ain&#39;t the semi-official Queen of the Indies for nothing&#39;. So when writer/director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a film was born. Though we catch up with the same characters many years, they&#39;re in a completely different sort of dark comedy; this one&#39;s laced with espionage! Henry may have been an international spy - and possible double, or even triple, agent - for years before meeting the others. He&#39;s either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries. Everyone wants his rambling, incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. Posey&#39;s Fay is either the wife he left to go on the lam, or his widow, depending on who&#39;s telling the truth. Fay&#39;s efforts to find Henry and/or the hotly-contested journals include a globe-trotting gauntlet of multinational hit-persons and henchmen at every turn. She never knows who to believe or trust. Nor do we.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While herding these unlikely characters into Jason Bourne/Jack Ryan territory, Hartley&#39;s script retains the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance, steering clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical menaces. His sly lampoon of the paranoia, duplicity and musical-chairs alliances of today&#39;s geopolitics starts to crumble towards the end. Even so, fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley&#39;s recycling methods. (5/18/07)&#34;,
 &#39;The movie was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the story writer just don\&#39;t hold water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past. Accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie just lack any substance. The only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story. And a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the central theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie fails to answer, why would I watch it anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least some strange legendary Flying Elephants, psychic king, or the eccentric king such as &#34;The King and I&#34; would have been lovely, something would have added greatly to the movies\&#39; appeal. I guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you got the appeal, then the story is the next thing we concentrate on. In marketing terms, we call it &#34;must see&#34;. Upon hearing the title of the movie people would say, Oh, I must see it. Now where\&#39;s the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it, &#34;How NOT to be a King?&#34; and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days, to the style of &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34;. That would have been much more interesting. Narrative-like experiences of the foibles of the King from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most movies today have that &#34;must see&#34; appeal, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they don\&#39;t have familiar characters, some other movies such as, The Island, had an appeal itself when the advertising asks &#34;Do you still believe there is an Island?&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or for the movie, retitled &#34;How NOT to be a King&#34; might ask the question, &#34;So do you still WANT to be a King?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parhat&#39;,
 &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big-time horror/sci-fi fan regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video, this has to be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again) and people running around screaming from left, then to right, then back again. It should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged out very long. It is very, very x5 low budget. Many scenes were way, way too long. Narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking. This is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji,and Godzilla vs. megalon despite their higher budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet, avoid it like you would an undead brain-eating mob. The Why-Did-I-Ever-See-This-Piece-Of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. Epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc..ad infinitum. -infinity/10&#39;,
 &#34;This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting. I never tire of watching it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover&#39;s character and Kevin Kline&#39;s character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together. Kevin Kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often. SO its a very &#39;real&#39; movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most powerful scenes in the movie however, is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack&#39;s car has broken down. The movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there&#39;s one person preaching his guts out to an audience. Instead the actors&#39; emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words. And lastly, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.&#34;,
 &#34;Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the Pie movies more of a commercial success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s be honest - Heder&#39;s acting was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into The movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable I&#39;ve ticked the spoilers box for this one line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to or watch and even then you&#39;ll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.&#34;,
 &#34;John Wayne &amp; Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory, and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah, USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting, with Wayne &amp; Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It&#39;s based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third, where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn&#39;t sit quite right, and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey, stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George &#39;Gabby&#39; Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma, particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget, it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10&#34;,
 &#39;This very peculiar setting of Wagner\&#39;s last opera definitely grew on me. When I first saw it, I was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images, and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story. However, if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherché &#34;gimmicks,&#34; I think you will find that the film DOES manage to capture the very strange, other-worldly atmosphere of the opera, and that there are moments which are particularly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrayed her. Her performance (a lip-synchronized mime of the singing voice of Yvonne Minton) is nothing short of dazzling, from end to end, and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of Robert Lloyd of the crucial role of Gurnemanz, one which Lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world. I have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera several times, and the lusciousness of his voice, and the warm, fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved, as did his performance in the character\&#39;s two major monologues, the Karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in Act 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The version I have seen was a videotape made for America, and so there were subtitles which, alas, could not be done away with. This is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely Christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera. This seemed to me to be quite contrary both to Wagner\&#39;s clear AVOIDANCE of Christianity, and his very deliberate attempt to &#34;generalize&#34; the Christian elements of the story. (See footnote with spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it nearly impossible, when viewing a film with subtitles, to keep from absorbing them, and strongly recommend that, if in the DVD versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off, you do so, and instead, if the opera is unfamiliar to you, that you read the libretto carefully beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that there is much in the film which I dislike, and would just as soon have seen done differently...but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since I first saw it, and I find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOOTNOTE CONTAINING A SPOILER: A good example would be Kundry\&#39;s famous line, &#34;I saw him...him...and laughed.&#34; This gets translated, in the subtitles, for reasons which escape me, as &#34;I saw the Savior\&#39;s face.&#34; It is especially irritating to me, because throughout the libretto, Wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character WHO NEED NOT BE THE BIBLICAL Jesus as &#34;der Heiland,&#34; i.e., the German for &#34;The Healer&#34;--a reference to the wound of Amfortas, and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing.&#39;,
 &#34;Being the prototype of the classical Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen O&#39;Hara (what an exquisite beauty!) and Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood at its best!&#34;,
 &#34;An overlong, but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other out, but the second half isn&#39;t as strong, due to the elimination of the Biko character. Still, its a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. Washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. Overall, a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit. 7/10.____________________________________&#34;,
 &#34;I have personally seen many Disney movies in my lifetime, though absolutely none of them match up in any way to Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally wouldn&#39;t have crossed live-action with animation, it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters. The movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country. I would have to say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest. Endings always surprise me and this was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if this was intentional. The dialog wasn&#39;t great, but considering it was designed to be a kid&#39;s movie, that is alright. Overall, I would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialog six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten.&#34;,
 &#39;I love these actors, but they were wasted in this flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only wonder, what WERE they thinking agreeing to this crap???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debra Winger just phoned it in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked &#34;Breaking the Waves&#34;, you\&#39;ll probably like this too. I hated both. 3/10&#39;,
 &#34;If you seen Rodney Dangerfield&#39;s previous movies and performances, you&#39;ll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. Written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the &#39;I&#39;m fat, and therefore funny&#39; John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that&#39;s trying hard not to be politically incorrect.&#34;,
 &#34;I watched this movie at 3&#39;o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it wasn&#39;t good, this movie wasn&#39;t good at all. The reasons why are many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting isn&#39;t all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90&#39;s Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats OK. But if I hadn&#39;t seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse. Like the ending, it came very suddenly, and I felt like I got no closure what so ever... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this This movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it didn&#39;t feel like a movie at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn&#39;t, and therefore, this movie turned out bad...&#34;,
 &#39;But sadly due to rights issues, that almost certainly will never happen. Transcripts of Joe Bob\&#39;s commentary on the sub B movies he screened are available on the internet, but they don\&#39;t quite capture his twang inflected delivery, which was a real hoot. Nowadays, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as &#34;I Spit On Your Grave&#34; (featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time), and Jason X, one of the most reviled Friday the 13th sequels of all time (the series was never the same once it left Paramount). All I could think when they canceled it was: &#34;Damn, where else am I going to get my fill of flesh ripping, blonde jokes, and horror trivia every Saturday night? Does this mean I have to get a life now?&#34; Sadly, it does. But there\&#39;ll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for &#34;Monstervision.&#34; Long live the Drive-In!&#39;,
 &#34;Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title &#39; Come Undone&#39;, April 25, 26, &amp; 27, 2001. The cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling. Even with fall/winter backgrounds for the &#39;present&#39; and spring summer for the &#39;flashbacks&#39; there can be some difficulty following the continuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether either lead is gay, the actors well-portray the budding relationship in real life terms; from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking. The story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning. But as the end approaches, you really care about where these guys will be next summer! You, too, will want a sequel to find out.&#34;,
 &#39;I have never seen a worse movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie you don\&#39;t bond with any of the characters because... you don\&#39;t get a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake 2: the worst gunfight scene ever. I love gunfights. I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is &#34;Apathetic&#34; I\&#39;ve seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME. In this movie it looked and felt like the &#34;Actors&#34; were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Where\&#39;s the trash talking? where\&#39;s the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recomend Sam Rami\&#39;s Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is house of the dead. I hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie.&#39;,
 &#39;There aren\&#39;t too many times when I see a film and go, &#34;huh, what?&#34;, but this was one of them. Maybe after seeing Zabriskie Point I felt much the same way Woody Allen felt after seeing 2001- he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period, realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on. Michelangelo Antonioni, in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US (after Red Desert, he did Blow-Up, this film, China, and The Passenger, all filmed outside his native Italy), I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium. The results show that he doesn\&#39;t lack the means to present images, feelings, tones, colors, sounds, and a visual representation of this era. &#34;A director\&#39;s job is to see&#34;, Antonioni once stated. Whatever that means, he doesn\&#39;t disappoint for the admirer of his post-fifties work (I say post-fifties since I\&#39;ve yet to see any of his films from before L\&#39;Avventura).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he does lack is a point, at least the kind of point that he could bring in Blow-Up and The Eclipse. You get the feeling of what is around these characters, what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness, however in this case the characters and the actors don\&#39;t bring much conviction or purpose. Antonioni, coming from the school of hard-knocks, neo-realistic film-making, does do what he can with his mostly non-professional cast (those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters), but the two stars Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin seem as if Antonioni\&#39;s under-directing them. Perhaps that was the point. The story\&#39;s split into three acts, thankfully not too confusing, as Mark escapes his existence around the boiling, dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60\&#39;s LA area, and Daria is sent out from LA to drive to Phoenix for some business meeting. They meet by chance as Mark\&#39;s plane (how does he know how to drive, maybe a little background info there?) and Daria\&#39;s car meet up, and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert. Aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene, much of this act isn\&#39;t terribly interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two leads are fair enough to look at, but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity? The ideas that come forth (in part from a screenplay co-written by Sam Shepard) aren\&#39;t too revealing, except for one brief instant where drugs vs. reality is brought up. Then the film heads towards the third act, as Mark decides to do the right thing, under disastrous circumstances, and Daria arrives at her boss\&#39; place, only to be in full disillusionment (not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film). Although the film took its time telling its story, I didn\&#39;t have as much of a problem with that as I did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer. I understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self-confidence of the &#34;anti-establishment&#34;, but maybe Antonioni isn\&#39;t entirely fully aware of it himself. In some scenes he as director and editor (and the often astounding cinematography by Alfio Contini) find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground. Not to say the technical side of Zabriskie Point isn\&#39;t involving to a degree (this may make some feel drowsy, as Antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say Francis Ford Coppola is). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deserts, skies, city, and even the faces in close-ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame, bringing us in. The soundtrack is equally compelling, with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point, and then a crushing, surreal Pink Floyd song (re-titled from \&#39;Careful with that Axe Eugene, one of their best pre-Dark Side) in the explosion sequence. If only the performances weren\&#39;t so one-sided I might find this to be on par with Blow-Up or The Eclipse. It\&#39;s an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand, and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60\&#39;s. But hey, what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US, such as say, Italy. And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing.&#39;,
 &#39;This is a quite slow paced movie, slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that there\&#39;s something wrong here ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end. It is clever, well paced and very well acted. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply into their characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little son &#34;pierrot&#34; is also very touching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thriller which does not seem like one. A very unconventional movie, very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i\&#39;ll give it a 8/10 !!&#39;,
 &#34;After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor---much worse than the acting in 80s T&amp;A movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal, but for those that have seen many movies, you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your time watching this.&#34;,
 &#34;Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. I&#39;m sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought that this would be a funny movie. But if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you&#39;ll miss most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;The 1st season was amazing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From then on, I was hooked The second season was right on par with the 1st season, only a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. I loved all the suspense surround others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season 2 amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Season 3 wasn\&#39;t quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless, great. I loved seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (&#34;Tricia Tanak Is Dead&#34; is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not as good, was still breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we\&#39;re good, but then it REALLY started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new &#34;rescuers&#34; such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and MOST OF ALL .... Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series: The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.&#39;,
 &#39;Three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego, and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over. Even though these folks were the scum of the earth I still found myself pitying them. They never really stood much of a chance.&#39;,
 &#39;This is an excellent, fast paced thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying - the evil of human beings. We are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer. The performances by Murphy and by Rachel McAdams (Claire, from The Wedding Crashers)are brilliant. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is action on a small scale, not the broad sweep of the canvas, and it is no less compelling for these limitations. The cinematography is nothing special, though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet, but the dialog is excellent, the story taut. There are no distractions, no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters. By keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting, fast-paced action thriller.&#39;,
 &#39;Linking story: another first-time viewing for me and, again, this is one of the most popular of the Amicus anthologies - and it\&#39;s easy to see why, though I realize how the film\&#39;s rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; I certainly fancied director Peter Duffell\&#39;s choice - DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which, incidentally, is a classical piece by Schubert that is heard in the film during the Peter Cushing episode) - a great deal more. Though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the individual stories themselves: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Method For Murder&#34;: the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, to make up for this, it\&#39;s quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (Tom Adams\&#39; \&#39;fictitious\&#39; villain looking like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [1932]); also, it ends with a satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist, and features a fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott in the lead. That\&#39;s all we need out of it, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Waxworks&#34;: for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand, and Ackland\&#39;s inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of Bunuel\&#39;s THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Sweets To The Sweet&#34;: this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here, Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee\&#39;s daughter). The film\&#39;s treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling \&#39;curtain\&#39;. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn\&#39;t quite put my finger on it. Later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of Agatha Christie\&#39;s &#34;The Mousetrap&#34; in London\&#39;s West End, which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of 2002! Needless to say, we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil, mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Cloak&#34;: a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; Ingrid Pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made up to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the \&#39;silent-cinema\&#39; style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience, I suppose - and, while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a\&#39; la THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967) or THEATRE OF BLOOD (1973), it\&#39;s also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering I had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one\&#39;s enjoyment of the film. As for the extras, beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you\&#39;re left rather expecting there to be more!) and, as such, it\&#39;s an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. The featurette &#34;A-Rated Horror Film&#34; is a worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid, if all-too-brief, contributions from producer Max J. Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get film notes, reviews, bios and a poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that).&#39;,
 &#34;Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia, a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick, fast-talking, charming womanizer Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and boorish, surly, racist biker Bloss (a terrific William Forsythe), who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he&#39;s forced to share a room with. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married girlfriend Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt). But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This remarkable movie&#39;s key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste, wit and warmth, specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one&#39;s lifestyle, including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). Besides the expected poignancy, the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw, earthy humor that&#39;s highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding, with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss&#39; doting, amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses. Despite the grim subject matter, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. A simply wonderful little gem of a drama.&#34;,
 &#34;A low budget effort from Texas that&#39;s at least filmed well, but that is little consolation. Bad acting, or, should I say, bad over-acting, a pretty limp story line that&#39;s nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots, of which there are a lot. Putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs.&#34;,
 &#39;first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting (some which would give me a better subjective opinion and NOT an objective one as it should by giving this one, WELL DESERVED, star) but then i know that those facts are used for the actor(S) NAMES to increase the rating of something like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do have a problem with such productions; yet another attempt (just like &#34;untraceable&#34;) of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights( how interesting that it comes at a moment when IPS providers trying to &#34;preferentiate&#34; = CENSOR information, and the Americans and Canadians are fighting AGAINST that at this very moments). this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil ( that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net), but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole. SEEMS LIKE FEAR PROMOTION IS HOLLYWOOD\&#39;S NORM THIS DAYS, especially when coming to thrillers which is the most &#34;on demand&#34; motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so = most viewed, best way to try influence the society as a whole. such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and &#34;ethical&#34; people, that it gives a new much needed meaning to &#34;anti-heroes&#34; figures. make no mistake , this is NOT &#34;DEXTER&#34; which was meant to be high-quality entertainment.STOP SELLING &#34;FEAR&#34; please, the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an Erroll Babbage that is CLEARLLY suffering of sexual frustration. the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist(for sure a &#34;cliche&#34; at least) ( in real life someone would probably get a beating for it, you will see what i mean). the second scene ( with Claire Danes\&#39;s character present) is even more extreme. at that point i realized, in my opinion that Erroll Babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him.how many people, that have seen or will see this movie, have never been &#34;hold down&#34;(regarding BOTH sexes) out of self, COMMON gratification!?.typically the movie gives an extreme CRIMINAL case(that unfortunately did, is and will likely happen again sometime , somewhere) BUT fingers everyone else indirectly as well as &#34;you could become that&#34;, etc. anyone that is familiar with Sigmund Freud and Jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone &#34;asses&#34; , by such fanatical &#34;hero&#34; here. SAFE sex in its many forms IS healthy and not some evil that apparently Richard Gere character is obsessed with , on his way for some sexual &#34;crusade&#34;. have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys!? or for how long an American teenager can see extreme violence on &#34;pg-13&#34; but he can not even see a woman breast until &#34;R-18&#34;!?!?( yet the industry targets them with this VERY SAME sexual perversions like &#34;american pie&#34; series for example).raise the kids tester-one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to UNhealthy EXTREMES!? all sexual activities(upon MUTUAL acceptance) integrates individuals better then some &#34;rightous&#34; nut-case, THAT blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on &#34;the lives of others&#34;( a new German movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject).here, like in that movie, you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very disappointed with Richard Gere especially after the recent &#34; hunting party&#34;, a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic &#34;hero&#34;( after real facts as well).but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone\&#39;s political and social agenda. &#34;the flock&#34; and &#34;untraceable&#34; 2 heads of the same hidden beast)))it just reminds you, if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a WHOLE, as Erroll Babbage has those here, to stay clear of them for THEIR own safety.they would kill my family faster then any 0.00001 chances of Paul Jerrod in anyone\&#39;s life would...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about MY &#34;assesment&#34; of this particular movie ( and &#34;untraceable&#34; actually), so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did. nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the &#34;foot&#34;.))))for once i agree with the rating, this is not a feature for teenagers or kids; simply because at best would confuse them even more then the &#34;common&#34; belief of &#34;money+fame+fashion&#34; and how that relates to sexuality. &#34;scream&#34; series and movies as such AT LEAST have a defined entertainment value(even if a dumb one in my opinion). but this one is just another &#34;trust me i know what is good for you&#34; deeply (not so well done i might add) subliminal messages.&#39;,
 &#39;This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. This film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. Solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office. An excellent piece of work!&#39;,
 &#39;This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time. Just plain torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it\&#39;s ONLY holes - and the excitement factor? Well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK\&#39;d this drivel, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: &#34;Sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! Our audience are idiots!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hooked just to know how it could get any worse. This is not a good sign, folks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should be ashamed for watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ashamed. I\&#39;m off for a long shower.&#39;,
 &#39;This scary and rather gory adaptation of Stephen King\&#39;s great novel features outstanding central performances by Dale Midkiff,Fred Gwynne(who sadly died few years ago)and Denise Crosby and some really gruesome gore effects.Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style,and manages to make this one of the few versions of King\&#39;s work that is not only worth seeing,but genuinely unnerving.The depiction of the zombie child Gage(Miko Hughes-later in &#34;New Nightmare&#34;)is equally noteworthy,as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky.As for the people,who think that this one isn\&#39;t scary-watch it alone in the dark(eventually with your squeamish girlfriend)and I guarantee you that &#34;Pet Sematary&#34; will creep you out.Some horror movies like this one or &#34;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&#34; shouldn\&#39;t be watched in group.Recommended for horror fans!&#39;,
 &#34;Wow. Uhm...well...wow! I guess I&#39;ll start with the plot. A betrothed woman (Lucy) arrives at the family home of her would be husband (Mathurin) in France, where they are awaiting the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) While waiting, young Lucy learns about a legend of a Beast who roamed the grounds centuries before. In bed that night, she begins fantasizing about the Beast and his rape-turned-consensual tryst with the former lady of the house. That&#39;s where it gets interesting! The plot is really pretty thin (and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick), but the filmmaker rewards (?) those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie isn&#39;t for everyone. If you&#39;re looking for great cinema, look elsewhere. If you&#39;re looking for a far-out movie about bestiality (that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject) this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, don&#39;t be afraid of this one. Outside of some horse-on-horse action at the beginning, the &#39;deeds&#39; are pretty cartoonish, IMO)&#34;,
 &#34;Many of the American people would say...What??? to my opening comment. Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. The great difference is the way that the story takes. Our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, HEROES. Please watch again this incredible movie (the Seven Samurai, obviously) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. A tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to wrote his Best seller&#39;s, but he didn&#39;t found the third foot of the cat.&#34;,
 &#39;We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad, but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring.&#39;,
 &#34;Firstly let me say that I didn&#39;t like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay. Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it. I am pleased with Storm and Christian being tag champs, best match was the Booker T and Big Show match in my opinion.&#34;,
 &#39;I absolutely loved this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the &#34;Two of Us&#34; took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what &#34;might have been.&#34; Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on. I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances.&#39;,
 &#34;Stephen Feinberg, who Played the Proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, passed away in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in Hollywood years earlier, working mostly on TV promos. He asked me not to see &#39;Tunnel Vision&#39;, but it was too late, I had seen it already! Actually I had seen it years before, when it was released. At that time I didn&#39;t think it was that bad a movie. However seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. Yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. That said he was just a little proud of &#39;The Proctologist&#39; sketch.&#34;,
 &#39;Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I\&#39;m offended that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I\&#39;ve seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. There is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the &#34;adventures of dickman&#34; scene was sophomoric at best.. Color me p***ed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. NEVER WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. That\&#39;s saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. It\&#39;s many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably. Crash and burn....&#39;,
 &#34;This film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for TV, but it is one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It is gripping, fascinating, and it will absorb you completely. The story of a chase for a killer in iron-curtain Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction -- but it&#39;s ostensibly a true story. I highly recommend it.&#34;,
 &#34;Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) don&#39;t reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself, an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest circa 1950, a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins an orphaned, would-be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the bickering twosome become prospectors. Some lovely vistas, and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man, are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy-drama, with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty, but--although the camera loves her pouty, glossy beauty--she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever); every time she opens her mouth, one is inclined to either cringe or duck. *1/2 from ****&#34;,
 &#34;This is the movie I&#39;ve seen more times than any other (I believe I saw it on average once every year since it was released). And every time I see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex Yu cinematography. This movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection.&#34;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up. He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he\&#39;s now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. But with \&#39;Rush Hour 3\&#39;, where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker (of all people!), and then there\&#39;s \&#39;Kung Fu Panda\&#39; where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, Chris Tucker-free days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter \&#39;Police Story\&#39;. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial. He faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the other hand, who cares? We don\&#39;t watch Jackie Chan films for the story. We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on that level, \&#39;Police Story\&#39; doesn\&#39;t disappoint at all. There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant, high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also comedy, much of which involves Kar-kui inadvertently upsetting May (Maggie Cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend. The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so I\&#39;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting isn\&#39;t too subtle, either. Indeed, I\&#39;m not sure there was anything subtle about \&#39;Police Story\&#39; at all. Director Jackie Chan (yeah, he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we\&#39;re waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So \&#39;Police Story\&#39; is a blast. As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new &#34;Wow!&#34; factor is added to the action.&#39;,
 &#34;Ghost Story (the TV Movie--1972) was the pilot for the NBC series. The movie was well-written and well-acted and, I thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this film was available on video!!) The series was a colossal disappointment--even with William Castle as exec. producer. If, however,you have a chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You won&#39;t be disappointed.&#34;,
 &#39;The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studies made so well in the 40\&#39;s and 50\&#39;s. The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people, including cloth manufacturers, the cloth mill\&#39;s workforces, and even an old lady that does her washing every week. The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances, and the way that they don\&#39;t always help; as the old woman says at one point in the movie, &#34;Why cant you scientists just leave things alone?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot Ealing comedies, this one stars Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence (and he does in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way. He is suitably creepy in this film, and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious, but slightly naive scientist. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood, the deep voiced actress that co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine &#34;Kind Hearts and Coronets&#34; and Michael Gough, a man that would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman films. The acting in the film isn\&#39;t always great, but it is always decent, and it\&#39;s fits with the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent, thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral. The comedy isn\&#39;t always obvious, and it doesn\&#39;t always work, but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs, so that is forgivable. I recommend this movie, basically, to anyone that is a fan of movies.&#39;,

 &#39;This is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as &#34;intellectual horror&#34; cinema, this film is it. I started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me, and it barely has a plot! I\&#39;m going to have to see this film again multiple times before I feel I really understand it. If you\&#39;re the kind of person who likes &#34;My Dinner With Andre&#34; and films by Godard, or if you do a lot of mind-altering drugs, you will probably enjoy this film. Wow.&#39;,
 &#34;One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she never meant for Lena to bed Goebbels, but in that case, why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the mens&#39; release, such as the disaster that was Stalingrad, or the Nazis&#39; fear that the international press, based in Berlin, would find out about the protest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again? Surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history! In places, it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this film failed in its aim, which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance, which is a shame, because done better, it could have had a major impact.&#34;,
 &#39;Wow...sheer brilliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching this, I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either not written in depth or too much depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog, messed up plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and lousy development overall, then this is the one to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep focused for the classic &#34;food processor&#34; scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid, daring or brave.&#39;,
 &#34;Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To have a chance at obtaining an education, Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn&#39;t the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy, anyway. At her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she&#39;s a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs&#39; male friend thinks she&#39;s a man, but pins &#39;him&#39; to the ground, sits on top of &#39;him&#39;, and looks affectionately into &#39;his&#39; eyes.... *snicker*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mediocre film; splashy story about nothing particularly interesting.&#34;,
 &#34;My kid makes better videos than this! I feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent renting this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what&#39;s even worse, there&#39;s no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he&#39;s getting a recent film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that I&#39;m amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video. It might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960&#39;s, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there&#39;s no hint that that is what you&#39;re getting. If you do make the mistake of renting it though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn&#39;t get any better after the first scene; so, knowing that, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fast asleep long before the end.&#34;,
 &#34;Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended I&#39;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I can&#39;t imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite,.... I just can&#39;t say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, I am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on DVD. When that will happen, I don\&#39;t know, but I will grab it when it\&#39;s released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn\&#39;s most entertaining film, especially when &#34;Gentleman Jim&#34; Corbett\&#39;s ring career begins in the film. Then it goes from a good film to a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as Flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that. Reportedly, this was Flynn\&#39;s favorite role and I believe that. You can just sense how much fun he was having here. Ward Bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, was never better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done, too. Corbett\&#39;s family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during Jim\&#39;s matches. Out of the arena, Corbett\&#39;s family\&#39;s constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan\&#39;s speech to Corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some mean-spirited critics (Variety, for example) didn\&#39;t like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. And, in this case, it made for a nice story and nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman, not anything like Flynn\&#39;s portrayal, but Flynn still make him a good guy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the more entertaining classic films I have ever watched and I eagerly wait for the DVD.&#39;,
 &#39;Rather than move linearly from beginning to end, this story line of a gay couple impacted by AIDS &#34;orbits&#34; in time around their &#34;perfect day.&#34; The film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The narration has its lyrical moments, particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced. The dialog unfortunately lacks such grace. The script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment. On their second accidental encounter, clearly smitten with each other, sensitive Phillip encourages a reluctant Guy to tell him about his difficult week. But the moment Guy begins to open up, Phillip, an English Major, blurts out &#34;You\&#39;re not a Crisis Fairy, are you?&#34; Later, watching his lover\&#39;s naked, chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him, our young Shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words, &#34;The way you cut through space....I can\&#39;t even describe it&#34;--but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought. This kind of drivel continues through the AIDS Hospice scenes, bejeweled with lines like, &#34;What made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons?&#34; and &#34;You make Florence Nightingale look like Nurse Ratchet.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety. Unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller-flattened than they need to be. Phillip\&#39;s thoroughly annoying friends--an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining, needy dweeb--maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path. Such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary, but sadly, their remarks are merely unpleasant, ungraced by wit or insight. It\&#39;s hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether\&#39;s perimeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film. It does seriously explore 1980\&#39;s US middle class gay life: first encounters, courting, coupling, nesting, the complexity of open relationships, friction and fracturing, dissolution, physical abuse, rapprochement, forgiveness, terminal illness, death and survival. Leads Phelan and Spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time. Their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film\&#39;s painful weaknesses. The decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out-of-sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility, and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could I recommend the film? To sticklers for literary and technical quality, absolutely not! For easy going viewers in serious need of an AIDS survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty-pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in, maybe. But better written alternatives exploring the impact of AIDS on relationships of that era include: Philadelphia, And the band played on, Longtime companion, Angels in America, An early frost, Parting glances, Love! Valour! Compassion! and even Jeffrey.&#39;,
 &#39;The author of &#34;Nekromantik&#34;, Jörg Buttgereit\&#39;s second feature film, &#34;Der Todesking&#34; is a powerful masterpiece. Centered around a chain letter originating from a group called &#34;The Brotherhood of the 7th Day&#34;, the movie shows 7 episodes, each consisting of one day during one week, where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it\&#39;s rounds. Do not touch this one if you like Hollywood movies or musicals, enjoy happy or even remotely &#34;normal&#34; movies or expect a movie to be good only, if it is focused on stage acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nihilistic, avant-garde approach of Der Todesking well explains, why Buttgereit\&#39;s movies in general were banned in Germany, their native country of origin, during the 80\&#39;s and most of the 90\&#39;s. Der Todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen, but the meaningless apathy or depression most people\&#39;s lives consist of in general. Buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living, only reasons to stop, and in choosing how and when you die, you can also be the king of death, Der Todesking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buttgereit\&#39;s movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception. Featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies, &#34;art film&#34; would probably be the closest description every time. Der Todesking features an original method to shoot, create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene. During one scene, the camera slowly, continuously pans in 360 degree circle, while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day. During another, Buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man, while he dwells in his desperation. During a third, seemingly pleasant scene names, ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen, supposedly warranting the ban in Germany for this particular movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Episode movies (and especially this one, as the scenes are only vaguely connected) generally suffer from incoherence, and Der Todesking is no exception. While all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it\&#39;s consequences or subsequences in all it\&#39;s variations, there are very powerful episodes, yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material, partly draining the overall power of the movie - still, the the jaw-dropping, immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it\&#39;s more vague moments back to the status of greatness. The general atmosphere is baffling, awe-inspiring, highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival I took part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come. Not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans, this is a small, different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience. Whether it be confusion, amazement or even hate, you aren\&#39;t likely to be left cold by this, in my opinion the best, achievement of this small indie crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main theme of the movie, &#34;Die Fahrt ins Reich der Menschentrümmer part I-III&#34; was released in a limited 666-piece 8&#34; vinyl edition, which is now much sought after. You still can get the classical masterpiece by getting &#34;The Nekromantik&#34; soundtrack CD, which I highly recommend. The Lo-Fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky, almost illbient-like, makes an essential part of the movie\&#39;s atmosphere, and is something you would very, very rarely hear otherwise. Much recommended!&#39;,
 &#39;Alicia Silverstone (pre-&#34;Clueless&#34;) plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which isn\&#39;t especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character. Silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here, despite the picture\&#39;s kitschy undermining. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) isn\&#39;t bad, though the violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a cheesy camp-fest, but nothing exceptionally memorable either. *1/2 from ****&#39;,
 &#34;As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student, since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It doesn&#39;t matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you&#39;re studying cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that, just like in novels, in movies you should also construct your story in three acts: the introduction, the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic, for the regular movie, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that, ultimately, you can even deconstruct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In rough terms, TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then, the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunet&#39;s AMÉLIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film, thus you can&#39;t even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. You are expecting to be told a story, and it doesn&#39;t happen. Worst than that, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It doesn&#39;t make a point, or at least, not a valid one. Its point is childish, with a sense of vengeance. The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a lot more from this short. The movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film. I don&#39;t know the budget for this movie, but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits, merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where&#39;s difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, combined with a fine score. That&#39;s all. There&#39;s nothing else. There&#39;s no plot. And that&#39;s a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly, you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As absurd as the comparison may sound, I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography.&#34;,
 &#39;At the time, &#34;My Left Foot&#34; was the little movie that could. It was hugely popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small, independent film could make it all the way to the Oscars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, movies like &#34;My Left Foot&#34; are a dime a dozen, so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. It\&#39;s certainly a well made and competent film, but it\&#39;s clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis, who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown, a man living with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won Dustin Hoffman an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in &#34;Rain Man,&#34; and the Academy followed suit by giving Day-Lewis the same honor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing really separating this film from a big budget Hollywood production is just that -- its budget. In every other way it\&#39;s just as formulaic as any standard product. That\&#39;s not to say it isn\&#39;t a good movie, but it\&#39;s not a masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A-&#39;,
 &#39;My girlfriend has the habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies no-one has ever heard anything about. Admittedly, at times, it has led to some fun discoveries. Often times, the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She brought home &#34;Advice From A Caterpillar.&#34; She was excited because the box said it was funny. Lucky for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies where, unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself, you will hate every character in the movie. Until the introduction of the one nice character. Which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that, in the real world, would drive anyone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE ON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a bunch of emotionally vapid, stuck-up, pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers. Then, they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (an almost perfect guy). We then watch the woman, the annoyingly pretentious artist (in her 30\&#39;s?) freak out as she falls in love. So she tries to flee from the nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she\&#39;s been having great but empty sex. She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away. In the real world, she would have been quite successful. I certainly wanted to flee from her and I wasn\&#39;t even in a relationship with her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although its nice that the man \&#39;fought for his love\&#39;, I never wanted her to have him. (Nor did my girlfriend) She didn\&#39;t deserve him. And, why I wonder, did the director think that the \&#39;almost perfect guy\&#39; should be punished by having to win a relationship with her? When the artist was asking the \&#39;almost perfect guy\&#39; to leave, we were screaming for him to leave too. There\&#39;s a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance. Regarding the other characters, they were well acted, morally bankrupt and annoying characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a comedy and I can say I did laugh a few times in the film. Unfortunately, not much laughing happened until the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I had those laughs, I had been praying for the movie to end for far too long. I needed to get these vapid characters out of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don\&#39;t deserve, then this is the movie for you.&#39;,
 &#34;How do you spell washed up fat Italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment- since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career. In this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is fat, slow and very old looking in this movie, hardly a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing stock clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s time for Steven Seagal to retire- this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot: fat Italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response. This pretense, although pathetic and laughable, gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yeah. I did.&#34;,
 &#34;Of all Arnold&#39;s mid-&#39;80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn&#39;t more controversial as the last, it&#39;s a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have &#39;court-appointed theatrical attorneys&#39; or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest message of all is &#39;You are being lied to&#39;. It&#39;s no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It&#39;s a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It&#39;s no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It&#39;s edited and reshaped before being aired and it&#39;s only what the networks want you to see. Usually it&#39;s far from the real truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although rather different than Stephen King&#39;s book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say &#39;I&#39;ll be back&#39; (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he&#39;s still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a director I particularly like) was attached before Glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80&#39;s feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Harold Faltermeyer&#39;s score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I&#39;ve seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a &#39;Meet the Stalkers&#39; gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.&#34;,
 &#39;**SPOILERS BELOW!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cabin Fever has my nod for WORST film of the year...that I\&#39;ve seen that is. This movie is straight GARBAGE! There is so much wrong with the film you can\&#39;t help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but ultimately made nothing of it. The characters were as dumb as one can be; for the entire movie you\&#39;re just asking yourself &#34;why would you do that?&#34; or &#34;what\&#39;s your point in doing this?&#34;...this is how illogical and stupid the characters are. We get NO background into them, so naturally you really don\&#39;t give a rats as$ about their fate...you could only laugh at their stupidity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The \&#39;slut\&#39; (Marcy) for instance... was she that horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in that....its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila! UGH. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Why didn\&#39;t Bert just shoot the sick guy from the start? Movie would\&#39;ve been over that way....besides, they ended up killing him anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? \&#39;No, I\&#39;ll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one a blink away from death) to finally opt to walk outta there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul\&#39;s attempt to fish out the body of the Hermit, only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus? Pure STUPIDITY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an aquaintance to these idiots. I don\&#39;t think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie. In the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for, and he replied that \&#39;its for the niggers\&#39;. In the end of the film, 3 young Blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) go into the store....come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting. THEN, he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they\&#39;re his homeboys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!?!?!? How tasteless can one be, what were the filmmakers THINKING putting that in the movie? I as a Black man was of course offended by the initial \&#39;Nigger\&#39; comment. It was a tasteless, pointless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the point of the ending with the Black kids? Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier? To smooth things over with Black viewers, by making a joke out of it? Well, I for one, did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit. The whole movie was a joke....a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that shouldn\&#39;t be given the time of day. Peter Jackson really thought this film was that good? What film was HE looking at? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZERO * out of **** stars....if I could give it a lower rating I would. Please, fellow IMDb\&#39;ers, don\&#39;t waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a \&#39;movie\&#39;. This is one of the worst movies I\&#39;ve EVER seen.&#39;,
 &#34;I think my summary sums it up. I found it inane and stupid. I also saw the ending a mile a way. Everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a TV/Theater crossover anymore. Sometimes, it&#39;s better to let the movie stand alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others, its better to forget the movie altogether. This is one of the others....&#34;,
 &#39;The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent\&#39;s home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is a great surprise and a delightful movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of Dan\&#39;s column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns\&#39; family. My vote is eight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada&#34; (&#34;Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend&#34;)&#39;,
 &#34;This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. It&#39;s exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However, what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least.&#34;,
 &#34;I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan&#39;s purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it&#39;s minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don&#39;t buy it or rent it just for that, and don&#39;t be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.&#34;,
 &#39;When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn\&#39;t expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely awful. And that\&#39;s being generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the casting for the movie was terrible. You feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever. Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming &#34;PANCAKES!!!&#34; at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I\&#39;ve never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud, &#34;Where the hell did that come from?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just simply couldn\&#39;t believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me want to puke and then puke again. Then blow my brains out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching grass grow, perhaps, is a proper alternative.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m sick of people whining about Ewoks! True, they\&#39;re not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don\&#39;t care if they\&#39;re marketable. Yubb Nubb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie always leaves me in tears. It\&#39;s perfect. The end could not be better. I\&#39;m excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader\&#39;s helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It\&#39;s very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he\&#39;s vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is once again brilliant. It\&#39;s so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts &#34;NOOO!&#34; and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can\&#39;t wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!&#39;,
 &#34;This wasn&#39;t the major disaster that I was expecting, but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I&#39;m not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I suppose it&#39;s all a matter of taste. Personally, I don&#39;t find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television, but then again, I&#39;m not a fan of Jerry Springer&#39;s pathetic daytime talk show. I didn&#39;t get too bored watching this, but I was definitely never enjoying it, either. If you&#39;re in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that isn&#39;t too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve seen this movie more than once. It was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then. The only problem I had was with the title for the obvious reasons... One immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by Drake&#39;s! Leaving off the first part, &#39;Hound of Hell&#39; would have sufficed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. But this was an enjoyable Halloween fare offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. He asks the cab driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the native cab driver and Crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people&#39;s ethnic beliefs. &#39;Aw, Mr. Barry, I left that stuff behind when I came down from the mountains...&#39; - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as supernatural fare goes, this movie is still enjoyable.&#34;,
 &#39;I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day. I\&#39;ve seen it so many times, and I never get tired of it. Strangely enough, every time I watch it lately, it takes me right back to the very first time I saw it. Including this time. Must be that sense of mystery and &#34;What IS going on here?&#34; about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, the one part of the story that ALWAYS felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a HUGE effect on me-- Ruth. I think a lot of it was Gerald Fried\&#39;s score. A real masterpiece, that! The romantic section was reused-- much more extensively-- in THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. But of course, it debuted here. I get the impression that, out of all the girls Kirk knew over the years, she may have been the &#34;sweetest&#34;. When she said, &#34;Do you have to go?&#34;, combined with the music, I could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone commented online that Ruth looked older than he was, yet she wasn\&#39;t supposed to have aged at all in 15 years. Which makes me think... MAYBE she was one of the teachers at the academy. Kirk had an affair with an older woman! (Perhaps he thought back to this in &#34;MIRI&#34; when he told Janice, &#34;I never get involved with older women.&#34; Maybe he meant, &#34;...anymore.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading ST reviews the other day, I see where someone compared WHAT ARE LITTLE GIRLS MADE OF? with I, MUDD. But it seems SHORE LEAVE oughta be in there, too. What are all those &#34;people&#34; if not androids? And could &#34;The Caretaker&#34; be related to &#34;The Old Ones&#34; from the earlier episode? Whoever he is, he seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST where you have a race that is actually &#34;superior&#34; as opposed to merely thinking they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeoman Barrows seems to be filling in for Yeoman Rand. Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy showered on her, it\&#39;s just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! Sheesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing missing from the last several I\&#39;ve watched that snuck back in here was, Spock smiling. He was! I saw him. I really prefer knowing there\&#39;s 2 sides to him going on inside all the time, rather than this &#34;submerged&#34; business. When he said, &#34;Enjoy yourself, sir.&#34; near the beginning, you could see it wasn\&#39;t just his addressing his superior officer, but talking to his friend. And at the end, when he needlessly says, &#34;Totally illogical!&#34;, I can\&#39;t help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. He may not be smiling or laughing, but I think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy.&#39;,
 &#34;A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.&#34;,
 &#34;I came into this movie really wanting to line it. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don&#39;t get me wrong here, I wasn&#39;t expecting Citizen Kane, I was taking this for the B movie that it is. That said, it still fell short of the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. The acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all I give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. Is it worth seeing? I didn&#39;t wish for my two hours back, but I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d recommend it to others.&#34;,
 &#39;I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned. From the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein. Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s bleak, depressing and hopeless. While I don\&#39;t mind a less than cheery ending, I\&#39;m really very tired of the &#34;humans suck&#34; cliché that\&#39;s central to every movie. I know you can\&#39;t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how\&#39;s \&#39;bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil! Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim \&#39;til your arms are tired. This way you won\&#39;t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive. It\&#39;s silly, not thoughtful, and boring.&#39;,
 &#39;Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before going I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty nice rate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did this), but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like at all, the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogs, nothing lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: plenty of Siemens and Organics advertising on the movie. Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and Siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! All of this would be bearable if the plot, characters, romances, anything was good, but was bad, really bad! A &#34;don\&#39;t know how to do&#34; sex-in-the-city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your time or money.&#39;,
 &#34;The sequel to the ever popular Cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the Beauty &amp; the Beast movies. It&#39;s basically three short stories rolled into 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! He&#39;s sooo cute!), and Lucifer&#39;s awesome (as usual). I liked some of the newer characters as well, (Pom Pom was adorable and I did like Prudence.). Still, the storyline was somewhat limited, but still very cute. So, I vote 7/10.&#34;,
 &#39;This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn\&#39;t come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan\&#39;s straight man. I\&#39;ve read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing. My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a &#34;facilitator&#34;. Much like &#34;Grosse Pointe Blank&#34;, another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.&#39;,
 &#34;I bought this game on eBay having heard that it was a similar game to Elite. The gameplay is indeed very similar, and is very addictive. Once I&#39;d played it a couple of times, I immediately went back on eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too.... I have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie, it&#39;s brilliant. If you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game, simply set up a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to do and the software is included) and play to your heart&#39;s content. There are still a huge number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening, because you don&#39;t often meant other players unless you want to. So go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is staggering, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is nearly endless. Fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on eBay. Get one with the full written manual if you can (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it&#39;s loads better!&#34;,
 &#39;Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was alright but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like &#34;We have to nurture them, just like a baby&#34;. Woah! i thought she was gonna up &amp; breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry\&#39;s knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve\&#39;s dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!&#39;,
 &#39;Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is a bit dim, to put in mildly. She drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple. However, she saves the life of a prominent Arab, by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official. She charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks. Sniffing an opportunity, Presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the U.S. government. Even then, she messes things up at times, but she tries hard and learns a lot. She even grabs the romantic attention of a State department official. But, is there another sinister plot in the making, involving an Arab man who wishes to take another wife? A blonde one? LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie features Goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb &#34;as a fox&#34;, as they say. Sunny learns her way around the jungle of the U.S. government very, very well. She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings. Perhaps, the Arab community would be less than thrilled with this work, but for those who like to laugh, rent this today.&#39;,
 &#39;The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub! This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of &#34;real&#34; UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse than the worse low budget &#34;B&#34; film of the 50\&#39;s. An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid it like the veritable plague.&#39;,
 &#39;Trawling through the Sci Fi weeklies section of the local Video Rentals store I was losing hope of finding any good movies I hadn\&#39;t yet seen. Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse. My son is so jaded with current &#34;B&#34; Science Fiction that he hasn\&#39;t bothered seeing this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be noted I didn\&#39;t see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this WAS a really pleasant surprise! This is also no B movie. It\&#39;s not a &#34;blockbuster&#34; of the epic variety and doesn\&#39;t try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it\&#39;s plot to be fully savoured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously CGI at first view, but they get it right at it\&#39;s 2nd appearance, &amp; that aside everything else is top notch. In any case the affects are secondary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t give anything away about the plot. The plot structure has a Russian Doll aspect a little reminiscent of Basic Instinct (though with very different content).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just I will say that Choosing Jeremy Northam for the lead was a master stroke. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect, it\&#39;s a tad off key. See the final twist of the plot and you\&#39;ll see why that is such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is also just right with her &#34;will she kiss me - will she shoot me&#34; edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them.&#39;,
 &#39;Nahhh! Leila (Grace Mills) is a teenager turned on to Satan (and LSD) by her archaeologist fiancé Richard. There\&#39;s a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle, where Leila and Richard drink blood, drop drugs, join in sex orgies, dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants, masks and capes and the women don\&#39;t wear anything at all. Unfortunately, these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded &#34;spirit of evil.&#34; Leila also comes from a screwed up family, which doesn\&#39;t help either. Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. Her mother Patricia (Maria Perschy) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father\&#39;s death. To top it off, her sister (Maria Kosti) is a slutty semi pro golfer named (gasp!) Debbie Gibson. There\&#39;s plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. Two maids (a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone), plus Udo (Luis Induni), a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes, takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. Oh yeah and Borg, the pet German Shepherd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning, the doubting priest (zzzzz) who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. Leila tells him &#34;They say I am perverse and I\&#39;m going to prove it is true!&#34; During her birthday party, she tells her guests &#34;You make me sick! I hate you all!&#34; and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches &#34;I don\&#39;t want to see that fat ass!&#34; Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a &#34;sanitory,&#34; but Leila runs off and joins the cult again. She is rescued (again) and brought back home (for the third time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point in the movie, there\&#39;s only about ten minutes left to go and all we\&#39;ve basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird. It\&#39;s almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie, minus the gore and laughs. But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an EXORCIST-like possession flick. Unfortunately, the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear. Some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms, legs and face, she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. She begins reeking of rotted flesh, spits up some clear gunk, starts speaking in her dead dad\&#39;s voice, sneaks into her mom\&#39;s bedroom, slaps her around a bit and calls her a &#34;filthy bitch of a whore.&#34; In comes Father Adrian, who now finally believes she is indeed possessed, fends off her attempts at seduction, hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water. Doors open and close, a mirror breaks, there\&#39;s sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs, the spirit is out of her and into - guess who? Why, Borg the family pooch! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. It\&#39;s Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. But then there\&#39;s ANOTHER time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body. It\&#39;s so badly done, you really have no clue what to make of it, which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they\&#39;ve wasted an hour and a half on this worthless POS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screw the contacts, 1 out of 10 it is.&#39;,
 &#39;The story is being told fluidly. There are no interruptions. The flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly. Casting was superb. Young Ya\&#39;ara looked very much like Ya\&#39;ara would have looked at that age. Her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly. Director Daniel Syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story. The Cinematography is very good. You feel like you are with Ya\&#39;ara and Talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to note that even though &#34;Out of sight&#34; is not a direct translation of &#34;Lemarit Ayin&#34; Both names are very appropriate to the story.&#39;,
 &#34;I had to walk out of the theater. After an hour, all I was seeing was people cheating on wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut, and using the f-word like a diabetic using Equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate, talk about it, and swear at each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. Plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1)several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees murder scene 3) Vinnie stares moodily across Atlantic/East/Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on wife, and 5) Joey (most sympathetic character in the show) gets kicked out of his parents&#39; house. More than that, I didn&#39;t wait to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography and the interplay between the characters were superb, but THERE WAS NOTHING for them to DO. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for SOMETHING to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption. Either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.&#34;,
 &#39;This is a gory mess and pretty convincing. Corbin Bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her, the little &#34;tryst&#34; with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile! The last half hour of the movie is devoted to Bernson\&#39;s character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented performer, she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off. Nice legs, too!&#39;,
 &#39;I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Larson\&#39;s comments about it being a &#34;sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths&#34; were dead on. Writers probably shouldn\&#39;t get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natasha\&#39;s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie doesn\&#39;t seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too.&#39;,
 &#34;this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend this film, as it&#39;s issues are still widely available. it&#39;s funny, the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#39;t fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren&#39;t we all?&#34;,
 &#34;I took part in a little mini production of this when I was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me. I&#39;ve loved it ever since!! When I was younger, it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed but since I&#39;ve watched it when I got older, I appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can&#39;t imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis&#39; Nancy if the best character for me. She put up with so much for those boys, I think she&#39;s such a strong character and her final scene when... Well, you know... Always makes me cry! Best musical in my opinion of all time. It&#39;s lasted all this time, it will live on for many more years to come! 11/10!!&#34;,
 &#39;I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when I say this film is worth seeing. Overall, the story and gags are contrived, but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off. That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isn\&#39;t terribly intelligent, but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter. Very few of the film\&#39;s gags are high-brow, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are likable, too. I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolin\&#39;s character, since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. Plus, I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife (who serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable, and there\&#39;s never a scene where I thought to myself, &#34;Why did he want to marry her in the first place?&#34; The ending is Hollywood-ish, but it could\&#39;ve been much more schmaltzy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is talented. I haven\&#39;t had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee\&#39;s mainstream work. I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith\&#39;s films that I couldn\&#39;t help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles. And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles. Even in this movie, he doesn\&#39;t look perfectly comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she\&#39;s so damn likable. Of course, she\&#39;s a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out. I don\&#39;t know the actresses\&#39; name, but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and she\&#39;s always enjoyable to watch, which makes me wish she received better roles. I loved her so much in &#34;Airplane&#34; and &#34;Lost in America&#34; that it\&#39;s a shame she doesn\&#39;t get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. This is a funny, charming film. Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it\&#39;s always to see a good one among all these bad apples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My score: 7 (out of 10)&#39;,
 &#34;This movie was poorly written, poorly acted and very predictable. It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn&#39;t even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ejames6342&#34;,
 &#34;Well, it&#39;s all been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what&#39;s to be said. But the thing is, I have seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing reviews on all the movies that I&#39;ve seen. So, I have to write something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is stupid. It&#39;s truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash. The nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be. Don&#39;t they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. We don&#39;t see how the granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, you just don&#39;t sympathize with them. And uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better. We just hear him scream and we see nothing!&#34;,
 &#34;Gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialog, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas&#39; novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdi&#39;s opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not-too-virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, split up, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene... One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful rendition of LA in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman, and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn&#39;t even any beautiful singing?&#34;,
 &#39;This movie is the first of the six infamous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways. A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video, showing the torture. The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times, because you see punches in nearly every movie. This movie has a lot of gore so I would recommend this to people 17 or older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#39;,
 &#34;I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it&#39;s a good movie. But King&#39;s book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn&#39;t important. Overall, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off.&#34;,
 &#34;All in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses. Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a hidden past and the photography is stunning. To some, this may be too whimsical, to others boring - for me it is a gentle, well-told tale and perfect for family viewing. Now that&#39;s not something you get a lot of recently.&#34;,
 &#34;I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy&#39;s father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn&#39;t enjoy it. Even if I didn&#39;t read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.&#34;,
 &#34;Wow this movie sucked big time. I heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well. And with all the internet hype on this movie I figured what could go wrong? However the movie was just plain bad. It was boring and the character development was never there. Space Travelers was also a horrible movie, if you didn&#39;t like that movie there is no way you will like this.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of that. I&#39;m not here to discuss the entire film, just the greatest chase scene ever. When Eddie dumbs milk on Tim, he gets chased down the hallway. Eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player; buy the DVD and watch it slow). The best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door. But when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics (mainly friction); yet what lies behind the door is supreme. The steepest stair case in any school ever, which this jock proceeds to CLEAR in the air. In reality he probably would die of a broken neck. Not only does he defy all concepts of reality, he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks.&#34;,
 &#34;I normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (i don&#39;t even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the worst movie I have ever scene, and i&#39;ve seen a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don&#39;t as you run in the opposite direction.&#34;,
 &#39;Why would anyone want to see this?! If this was a film posted on YouTube by a teenager, I might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his mommy\&#39;s video camera. I might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting. Sadly, it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were, apparently, professional actors--making this a very, very sad film. Sad...and very pathetic, actually. As I said, it has a definite made directly to video look about it. It also has narration and acting that just scream &#34;unprofessionals&#34;--how could this be?! The film is filled with lots of corpses and blood. Normally this would turn me off completely, as I hate ultra-violent films and don\&#39;t like seeing all that gore. However, given that none of it is that realistic, it\&#39;s bearable. However, I should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing. For example, the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a lady\&#39;s tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad. There are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women. With a level of misogyny that is pretty awful. the people who wrote this are pretty sick--like killing women is meant to be for our entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bunch of senseless murders, the film goes to a dining room table--around which are a bunch of goof-balls wearing black hoods WITHOUT eye holes! They are talking, with pride, about all the murders they have committed and chant. It\&#39;s all very funny, though I am not sure that was the scene\&#39;s purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even vampirism and cannibalism. Why, I don\&#39;t know--perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap. And, once again, you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy German-looking man as he tracks down people and kills them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, considering the film used what I must assume are professional actors, I wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly Germans. While they tried to act like Americans and the film was supposed to be in California, the accents are STRONG. Perhaps German audiences watched this and marveled at how &#34;realistic&#34; the acting was, but to any American it\&#39;s obvious these folks ain\&#39;t their fellow Americans! Considering that there really WAS a zodiac killer (who was never captured), I do wonder why anyone would want to make a &#34;fan film&#34; of sorts for the sick menace?! I mean...was this film meant as a snuff film for pervs? I just can\&#39;t see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it. In fact, I wonder what would motivate anyone to make such a stupid AND offensive film?! Worthless and deserving to be in IMDb\&#39;s Bottom 100 list.&#39;,
 &#34;To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney&#39;s latest animation installment. The Film had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical. I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it might be a goofy 80\&#39;s movie that would be enjoyable on some level, so my brother and I watched it. Boy did it suck. Boy gets crush on girl--correction, his *dream*-girl (apparently there is a difference; and I\&#39;m surprised he realized she was his dream girl--he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away. I guess that just goes to show the power of dream-girls), boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream-girl (creative in the sense that it\&#39;s a far-out plan, but un-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up), awkward situations ensue, a match is made (all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon--either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting, or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day-jobs to come to the set; I suspect the latter). Very clumsily done, very pathetic. It\&#39;s almost never even amusing *accidentally*, so there really is nothing to redeem it. Unless you\&#39;re interested in seeing Chad Lowe\&#39;s early days, before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the HIV-positive gay guy on the series &#34;Life Goes On&#34;, or Gail O\&#39;Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably got to stare at Dennis Franz\&#39;s buttocks). But those are unlikely motives--I\&#39;d say &#34;systematic derangement of the senses&#34; would be a more justified purpose. I\&#39;m surprised I watched it all. I guess it\&#39;s the kind of thing where, halfway through, you find yourself *still* watching due to some morbid, self-flagellistic inner-issue, and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie, on the off-chance that it\&#39;ll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health. Can *You* Take the Challenge?&#39;,
 &#39;Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the \&#39;heroes\&#39;, such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly\&#39;s lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned\&#39;s right hand man), and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him &#34;sunshine&#34; and had a &#34;glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder,&#34; it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, don\&#39;t all Aussies love an underdog?&#39;,
 &#39;Talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more, a rather deliciously complex murder! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as murder mystery films go, it just doesn\&#39;t get any better than this one. Populated with suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim Archer Coe, it\&#39;s truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one\&#39;s head around it but boy, does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us. Even the cops, the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful, fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one\&#39;s proceedings and amping up its overall &#34;fun&#34; factor. I particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one\&#39;s running time. Also Eugene Palette\&#39;s Detective Sgt. Heath provides welcome, often later delightfully humorous at his expense, critical commentary during Vance\&#39;s investigation. I cannot think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it hasn\&#39;t dated particularly well. Doesn\&#39;t stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one\&#39;s mystery. Highly recommended you try!&#39;,
 &#39;I give this a generous four out of ten stars, or dots or markers, or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear!!) moved along agreeably enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the usual trafficking in stereotypes, blazing speed, rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack, and &#34;soundtrack&#34; is generous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the two really really funny scenes involved Amy P. She\&#39;s just really hilarious in an animal kind of way. She\&#39;s a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on SNL and Lucille Ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just flat out admitted they did this for the money, because if by doing it, it gave birth to the Sarah Palin parodies, then I guess we can say, yeah, it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role, who\&#39;s really there to help you be more human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blah. 4 outta 10 like I said is generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mom from &#34;Two and a Half Men&#34; is in this movie, and she\&#39;s had some kind of plastic surgery, so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old, so every scene she\&#39;s in, I\&#39;m like trying to rearrange her face, or put it together in my mind, or just answer the question, &#34;No. Wait. Wait. HAS she had plastic surgery?&#34; Because as a viewer, you really don\&#39;t want her to have had plastic surgery.&#39;,
 &#34;I thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part. Since I am a filmmaker, I give it a 2 for consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. The computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with, but did not find that information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged. The actors weren&#39;t bad, but the plot needs more innovation.&#34;,
 &#39;A noble effort, I guess, but ultimately a poor one. Before seeing this film, I felt &#34;Bartleby, The Scrivener&#34; was unfilmable. After seeing it, I still do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on, and they will be upset at the film\&#39;s needless revisions (updating from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the superb talents of Paul Scofield can\&#39;t salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film Melville\&#39;s metaphysical classic.&#39;,
 &#34;This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone is snorting heroin. If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin, then this would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie. It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. The lesbian stuff didn&#39;t bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.&#34;,
 &#39;I always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them... Well, in time I wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia. Or did that &#34;feeling&#34; decide to pack its bags and say &#34;goodbye&#34; somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then never came back? Or did it? Because for me, it came back the first time I saw &#34;Ekspres, Ekspres&#34;. And it was it\&#39;s old self again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of the colors and, what I appreciated the most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something many of other (not just) Slovenian screenwriters should at least consider). There is no use for words, when you can understand each other just as well (yeah, or better) by other means in use. Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. Uh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this, in only so many words, is why I would recommend &#34;Ekspres, Ekspres&#34; to all of you, as a must-see Slovenian movie, regardless of what you may heard of Slovenian films (if you ever even heard anything , that is...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and that scene, where Bakovic is dancing to Vivaldi\&#39;s music... A treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself. Watch it.&#39;,
 &#39;First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and &#34;Soldier Blue&#34; traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she maintains zero interest, with zero believability. The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village. This is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti-war propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and contrived. Not recommended. - MERK................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here\&#39;s an idea. Why don\&#39;t you actually watch the movie you are commenting on, instead of chirping your liberal nonsense. This is not a political site, it is for reviewing films. - MERK&#39;,
 &#39;Band Camp was awful, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor. Basically Erik Stifler (John White) split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now him and Mike \&#39;Cooze\&#39; Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joining Erik\&#39;s cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) at college. With the promise of many parties, plenty of booze, and enough hot chicks at the Beta House, they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members. But a threat comes into sight with the rivals, GEK (&#34;Geek&#34;) House, led by power-hungry nerd (and sheep shagger) Edgar (Tyrone Savage) offering bigger and better than what Beta have. To settle it once and for all, Beta and Gek go into battle with the banned, for forty years, Greek Games to beat each other in, with the loser moving out. The last champion of the games, Noah Levenstein aka Jim\&#39;s Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees the people unhooking bras, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching a greased pig, Russian Roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk, wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol (with puking not disqualifying). It all comes to the sudden death, with a guy getting stripper lap dancing, and they have to resist cumming, Beta House win when Edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. Also starring Flubber\&#39;s Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The nudity amount is very slightly increased, as is the grossness of the jokes, and I could guess it being rated one star out of five, but I like it. Adequate!&#39;,
 &#34;If this is based on the true-life relationship, as purported, between Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I&#39;m thrilled I do not know them personally. This is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground. Many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy.&#34;,
 &#34;Always fancied this film from the video cover. Eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film. A simply stunning performance from all of the case and it&#39;s filmed so beautifully. Even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale. It&#39;s really moving, frequently amusing and very watchable. Not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout. A 9/10 from me. A must see.&#34;,
 &#34;Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake-looking than they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot had no sense whatsoever. I mean, first they&#39;re on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they&#39;re on a boat. And let&#39;s be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for which I gave this a 3, is because it&#39;s still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (haven&#39;t watched the second yet). Just, don&#39;t rent it. I saw it on TV and it&#39;s a good thing I did because I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to waste money renting it.&#34;,
 &#34;Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover at the video library? No. Was it a &#39;food fr thought&#39; as the author was maybe trying to make it? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average movie, that had great potential, and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points, beginning middle and end, with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy, who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall. It was nice cinematography, with good colours, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it&#39;s going and where it has just been. And with a feeling of let&#39;s just quickly wrap it up in the end. OK to watch if there&#39;s nothing else on TV.&#34;,
 &#39;The original &#34;Cube&#34; is a fantastic B-movie rich with paranoia, meaty characterization, and fine over-the-top performances. It\&#39;s creepy, cryptic, and cool. And it stands perfectly well, on its own, without a stupid sequel like &#34;Cube Zero.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This third (!) film in the Cube series is part retread (most of the booby traps are sadly recycled), part aberration. It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first movie - but, since said explanation is bland, I\&#39;d rather it was kept a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube, but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What works? Basically nothing. The acting is purely amateur hour, the pacing is slow (how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen?), and the gore effects, while revolting, fail to convince. In short, &#34;Cube Zero&#34; reminded me of a &#34;Cube&#34; fan-fic, a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.&#39;,
 &#39;I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially &#34;Strictly Ballroom&#34;. While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch.&#39;,
 &#34;This movie has a very hard-to-swallow premise, even by this genre&#39;s standards. We are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life, but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed SPECIFICALLY at one kid, when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive, and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up. Anyway, the film is fun for a while, but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy-like horror icon, they were way off: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, and no variety. (*1/2)&#34;,
 &#39;I really liked this version of \&#39;Vanishing Point\&#39; as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version) than to me, it is not all that great. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. However, I have seen many remakes, where I have liked the original and older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn\&#39;t so &#34;blase&#34;.(Boring)&#39;,
 &#39;I must say that during my childhood I\&#39;m quite proud of a lot of the movies I\&#39;ve rented. The exception being Theodore Rex. Talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor\&#39;s resume. Could you just imagine what Whoopie\&#39;s fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap &#34;Hey Whoop, you ever seen that show Dinosaurs, yeah well they\&#39;re making a movie out of it, and you get to see Germany!&#34; After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed. I just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory, because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie. I mean c\&#39;mon, I\&#39;ll even admit I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons why I gave up on both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for awhile), yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest rental regret of my life, and that was 16 years ago. I\&#39;m 24 now if you want to do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I think of my all-time list of worst movies I don\&#39;t even mention this one, because like a raped step-child, I try hard to repress that it ever happened. Screw you Whoopie, just be glad people only acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff.&#39;,
 &#34;One can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this film was just too much. Practically nothing was even close to truth, and even for the era, it was seen as silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In defense of ford, it was revealed on an old talk show, that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile, and replayed the scene his own way. Earp told the director about the stagecoach, and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie portrays Earp as an honest man, and also his brothers. History doesn&#39;t exactly say they were or weren&#39;t. Most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters, but that is nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old West, you didn&#39;t have time to think about too much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characters that don&#39;t exist, characters depicted dying at the corral who really didn&#39;t, all make this a weaker film. It is further weakened by Mature, who really didn&#39;t make a convincing Doc. He may be the worst cast choice ever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth. After all, ford did get information first hand from Wyatt Earp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro Nazi in those days, and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to Hitler idealism. This occurs in most movies until the eighties. It is no excuse, and does cheapen the art, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors who play the Earps do well, and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, Mature may be the only acting downside of this flick. Still, it is the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn&#39;t have any of this in it. It doesn&#39;t give any insight-, or solutions to the problem. It&#39;s just the portrayal of &#39;old&#39; male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family. Why would you want to watch this? It&#39;s all so totally pointless and meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also really doesn&#39;t help that the main character is some wrinkly 50+ year old male. You&#39;ll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize for him. He just seems like a dirty old playboy, who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse&#39;s about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#39;t have a bad visual style, though it all feels a bit forced. But nevertheless it&#39;s all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the film-makers had been given better material to work with, the movie would had deserved a better faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story really gets ridicules at times. There are really some pointless plot-lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be. I&#39;m talking about for instance the whole Ordell plot-line. Things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending. Also the whole way the story is being told, cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character&#39;s sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far as bad movies are concerned, this just isn&#39;t one of them. It&#39;s not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flick, with similar concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is. Guess they were really desperate for work and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#34;,
 &#34;Dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. To much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I didn&#39;t quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars. Just because there both up on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I&#39;m sure Rodney Dangerfield was really into that when he was alive. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke where people yell at the drive thru. I also liked the Reese&#39;s Pieces joke. If Dane just didn&#39;t act so mental he might be funnier and I might have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.&#34;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s been close to ten years since I\&#39;ve seen either of the last two sequels to &#34;Phantasm&#34; - surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good. That being acknowledged to this day, I\&#39;m still a huge fan of the first two installments so I thought I\&#39;d go back and re-experience the \&#39;final chapters\&#39;. Part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn\&#39;t make much sense... Again, kicking off right where the previous movie left us, Reggie saves Mike from the Tall Man who vows to come back for him later, but things aren\&#39;t safe for long when they come across Jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere. Apparently his soul is held prisoner by the Tall Man so Mike is then dragged into the sinister double-pronged Netherworld and Reg has to find him... Along the way, he meets up with a ten year-old kid and a nun-chuck wielding black chick named Rocky who assist him throughout his journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s really nothing memorable about &#34;Phantasm III&#34; other than how stupid and forcefully &#34;humorous&#34; it tries to be. Only one positive aspect that didn\&#39;t even help the movie and that was the return of A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic. The problem is, they pretty much make cameo appearances... Reggie Banister is of course back in his starring role, but his bumbling, love-sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like. Angus Scrimm also just didn\&#39;t seem entirely &#34;into&#34; his role. He talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the &#34;quirkiness&#34; that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to. Most people\&#39;s opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think &#34;it\&#39;s still entertaining&#34;. Maybe I\&#39;m just too much of a nit picker but I just couldn\&#39;t get into this one. I remember disliking it when I was a kid and after re-watching it - I can safely say - nothing has changed. Don Coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low-budget, nightmarish, legendary film &#34;Phantasm&#34;, which I still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and GORY, but &#34;Lord of the Dead&#34; (stupid title) just looked too rushed and slapped together to me... The inclusion of the two new characters, Tim and Rocky (the only thing missing was Scrappy Doo!!), was a strong indication of Coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it\&#39;s a &#34;Phantasm&#34; movie with very little gore, nudity, and quadruple-barrel shot guns. Need I say more?&#39;,
 &#34;This movie was heavily marred by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as I should say Steven So-dull! Like before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own lines, leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped. A few films before this was he has done this too, but I don&#39;t think to this extent! To be honest the film looks pretty good, the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie! Of course, all told, this film is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been much better without Seagal who has become a cartoon of himself. Don&#39;t bother. Anything over a buck for this one is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal film. What&#39;s taken me so long to realize this?!&#34;,
 &#34;I am a lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man, which the movie barely touched on. In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back to the science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development, terrible story, and I&#39;m sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker.&#34;,
 &#34;Tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an interesting moral &amp; emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who&#39;s complaining?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#34;This movie was awful. I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through. I didn&#39;t get the point of the movie. What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, acting was bad and the story uninspiring. The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I don&#39;t know this for a fact, but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers. The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot. That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. I would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite instead.&#34;,
 &#39;Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous!!! If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this. Yeah right.&#39;,
 &#39;I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was one cool kick off. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, he\&#39;s still in Japan...oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original...the demons are roaming in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called &#34;Demon Wardens&#34; are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess who\&#39;s sleeping and supposedly is very kick-ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brings us to Izumo...some kind of elite swordsman called &#34;Demon Slayer&#34; and his buddy Jaku who\&#39;s the typical violent jealous asshole...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems boring? Well now it thickens....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the &#34;impression&#34; that he was the demon, he never knew, but he did killed her. So Izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in Kabuki theater. In a boat joyride on a nice night, Izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons...for the good cause, the cause of love...and damn...the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes...he is the total package...he knows how to fight(hell yeah he knows), he\&#39;s witty, he\&#39;s intelligent and he has that grit. You never have to yell :&#34;NO IZUMO, IT\&#39;S A TRAP&#34; The guy already knows it he has that common sense. He\&#39;s really the perfect hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. It\&#39;s by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga. It\&#39;s creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic...it\&#39;s pretty amazing. Lots of colours an &#34;unreal&#34; photography, other than that...it\&#39;s pretty straightforward...but like I said, the main character is carrying the movie A must see, a tale lead by masterful hands&#39;,
 &#34;This movie was so very badly written. The characters had no depth. They should have never made a movie of this. My 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay then Hyung-rae Shim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only actor that didn&#39;t suck was the zoo guard. He was the only funny and believable one of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who actually thought this was a good movie, you are in serious need of brain surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the creatures in the movie weren&#39;t even dragons...so why did they call D-war?&#34;,
 &#39;...which isn\&#39;t exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall, &#34;DinoCroc&#34; was a much better movie. Sure, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in &#34;DinoCroc&#34; were better, the plot lines were better, and the acting was better. Here are the problems with &#34;Blood Surf&#34; -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid\&#39;s model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi &amp; Co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island, in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there\&#39;s not enough croc time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of &#34;Blood Surf&#34; -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie. But if you\&#39;re on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi/killer crocodile movie, skip this one and fire up &#34;DinoCroc&#34; instead.&#39;,
 &#39;This movie is like real life, by which I mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the &#34;experimental&#34; lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big bore. No big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved &#34;Gosford Park&#34;, but &#34;Pret A Porter&#34; anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. And no, it is not &#34;so bad it\&#39;s good&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s just bad.&#39;,
 &#39;Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem &#34;Woman in the Moon&#34; from this 1976 film. Easy to dismiss, the movie\&#39;s career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywood-style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand\&#39;s own &#34;Funny Girl&#34;. This time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troubles dog their courtship from the outset, as John Norman (both names please) responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence (from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution). To John Norman, Esther represents his last shot at happiness, and in turn, she is drawn to the innately decent, creative musician underneath the façade. In the movie\&#39;s most pivotal scene, he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off. Inevitably, he can\&#39;t handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson (although Streisand\&#39;s budding directorial talents are obviously on display), the film still manages to draw me in, even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star, her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly. The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock. From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos, she can\&#39;t help but come across as an established star. I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Norman\&#39;s woes become overwhelming. This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esther\&#39;s response to it. This is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics John Norman\&#39;s style toward the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristofferson, on the other hand, gives a superb performance throughout, managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love, pride and resentment toward Esther. He makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context. Otherwise, what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn\&#39;t exist unless they were interacting with the two principals. The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman\&#39;s level-headed manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie. Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print. A big seller in its day, the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970\&#39;s - some songs still quite good (&#34;Everything&#34;, &#34;Woman in the Moon&#34;, &#34;Watch Closely Now&#34;), some that have moved to kitsch (&#34;Queen Bee&#34;, Kenny Loggins\&#39; &#34;I Believe in Love&#34;) and of course, the inescapable &#34;Evergreen&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering. Streisand\&#39;s participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary. She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production. She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie\&#39;s producer, and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director. I just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen. She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her, e.g., it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters. I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970\&#39;s clothes, especially Kristofferson\&#39;s mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisand\&#39;s optional commentary. One is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies. Another is an extended scene in which she plays &#34;Evergreen&#34; on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which I agree with Streisand should have been used. Fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; are also included.&#39;,
 &#34;A good cast (with one major exception) pushes its way through Epstein&#39;s smart light satire. Mansfield was never better, or funnier, than she is here paired with Walston, who&#39;s a veteran who&#39;s determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his buddies -- including suave con-artist Grant -- head to San Francisco on leave and start the city&#39;s swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours. The only thing about this movie that&#39;s not delightful is Suzy Parker&#39;s one-note performance as Grant&#39;s love interest, which takes up too much of the film&#39;s time and slows down the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the gimmick is that she&#39;s set on making love to every serviceman (to do her duty for the war effort, of course) but he&#39;s a married man who, nonetheless, loves his wife. They steal the movie with little trouble from Grant (who&#39;s amusing here in the first part of the film, when not paired with his non-actor co-star.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh dear, Oh dear. I started watching this not knowing what to expect. I couldn\&#39;t believe what I was seeing. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government\&#39;s plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man, who is unarmed, and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack. If only it were really that easy. I\&#39;ve finally found a movie worse than &#34;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;WAR, INC. (2008) **1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hit-and-miss-21st Century &#34;STRANGELOVE&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Cusack \x96 who co-wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser \x96 stars as a jaded hit-man named Brand Hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a Middle-Eastern oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not THAT Omar Sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh) commandeered by the ex-Vice President of The USA (Aykroyd, Cusack\&#39;s old &#34;Grosse Pointe Blank&#34; co-hort, doing a mean Dick Cheney manqué turn here), enlisting Brand to do the deed under the guise of a Trade Show Producer in mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq/Afghanistan) for the American private corporation Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While being briefed Brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of Eastern European teen sensation Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff aping her own celebrity with tongue- through-cheek) and the idiot son of the country\&#39;s leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is a bold attempt for a 21st Century black comedy a la &#34;DR. STRANGELOVE&#34; but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message (an unjust war being outsourced by American capitalism, check!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned &#34;Pointe&#34; he does add some nice touches of his man in black (he does shots of Tabasco sauce to take the edge off), the rest of the cast plays catch up (except sister Joan who is a riot as the high-strung aide- de-camp for Hauser and has one of the film\&#39;s funniest laugh-out lines: &#34;My mass communications skills are finally paying off&#34;) for the most part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cusack visited the Iraq War earlier this year in the 180 degree different &#34;Grace Is Gone&#34; and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve ; while admirable overall the film\&#39;s pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker Joshua Seftel making his directorial debut here (and it is noticeable) except for maybe the well-choreographed fight Hauser is involved with Babyyeah\&#39;s idiotic fiancé\&#39;s entourage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice attempt yet a misguided failure ; maybe next time Cusack won\&#39;t try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself.&#39;,
 &#39;It is not as great a film as many people believe (including my late aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But due to the better sections of this film noir, particularly that justifiably famous &#34;fun house&#34; finale, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of importance beyond it\&#39;s actual worth as a key to the saga of Orson Welles\&#39; failure to conquer Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1946 Welles\&#39; position as a Hollywood figure was mixed. CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by Hollywood insiders themselves. Welles\&#39; attempt at total control (direction and production and acting) of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system. His best job in this period was as Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE, supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but actually shot in large measure (with Stevenson\&#39;s blessing) by Welles. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. But despite the assistance Mike Todd, and Cole Porter composing the score, the musical was a failure. His failure occurred just at the same time that his wife, Rita Hayworth, was on the rise with her portrayal of GILDA. So the marriage was going on the rocks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welles had to make money - his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in the possible movie rights to AROUND THE WORLD to Todd (which he would eventually rue), and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin, who was supposed to be directed in it (and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story goes that Welles, with a $10,000.00 tax bill to worry about, called Cohn and offered to do a film with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do so, but naturally asked what the film was. It was a wise question. Welles was on a pay phone in New York in a pharmacy that had a book department. He grabbed a book with the title THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and raved that it was a great thriller. Somehow Welles convinced the normally astute Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he\&#39;d look into getting the rights, and sent Welles his down-payment of $10,000.00. After Cohn hung up Welles bought the book and read it - and found it was really pretty bad. He spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up Rita\&#39;s character of Elsa Bannister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly it has a curious plot development. Michael O\&#39;Hara is a seaman/longshoreman. He rescues Elsa Bannister, when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation. She convinces him to hire Michael as the skipper of their yacht. The cruise also contains Bannister\&#39;s sinister partner George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and one Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia) who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa. When they can Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby keeps showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grisby makes Michael an offer - he wants (for reasons connected to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society) to drop out of it, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes murky here) he can still collect his life insurance (although dead?) and use it to run off to the South Seas. He will pay Michael $10,000.00 if he will pretend to shoot Grisby. This includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder (Michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course Grisby is killed, and Michael is arrested for that, and for the murder of Broome (shot with Michael\&#39;s gun). Michael is tried with Bannister defending him, and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual murderer, and manages to escape just before the jury verdict. He is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival, and this leads to the famous &#34;fun house&#34; sequence and the conclusion of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a terribly confusing movie (as I have had commented on). That does not mean it\&#39;s not worth seeing - visually it is striking. Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the trial judge\&#39;s quarters, where he knocks the bailiff into the judge\&#39;s bookcase, shattering glass. Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth diving from a rock, reflected on the lecherous Grisby\&#39;s binoculars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is pretty good, in particular Sloane (possibly that fine actor\&#39;s best film role). Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer. He rarely made movies before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable. Also Ted De Corsia does very nicely with Broome - a detective who is really looking for his own interests, to his own cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Hayworth, she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and THE STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions), and is a memorable siren. Welles\&#39; O\&#39;Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe. It\&#39;s not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL, or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it is a good film for all that.&#39;,
 &#39;I loved &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34;. A wonderful journey-to-love story like You\&#39;ve Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes, and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advice columnist who can\&#39;t seem to get things in his own life straightened out. Until one day, on a family gathering/trip, he meets and instantly connects with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche)a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema. Chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie must be off for a previous engagement, and they must part ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later we are treated to Dan\&#39;s tight-knit, fun-loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky Dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes. What I liked so much was that although the family\&#39;s characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some, I thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn\&#39;t venture into parody or crude exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for Dan. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren\&#39;t unrealistic. The family is nosey, but never mean-spirited or gossipy; quirky, but never outlandish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Dan falls in love with his brother\&#39;s girlfriend he\&#39;s brought to the family gathering. And thus begins a roller-coaster of restrained longing and funny love-budding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on but I just thought this movie was simply awesome. It\&#39;s not particularly &#34;hip&#34; or &#34;clever&#34;, never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema. There is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny-but-real dialogue. in fact, early in the movie, the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation where the characters say what they\&#39;re thinking out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I\&#39;ve probably rambled and repeated myself, but I highly recommend &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34;. It\&#39;s a great date movie, trust me, you\&#39;ll laugh, and only if you\&#39;re a geek like me you\&#39;ll get a bit teary-eyed. Filled with fun and magical love, &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; won\&#39;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade: A&#39;,
 &#34;OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,not really,in my opinion.there isn&#39;t a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow,tediously,in fact.it&#39;s also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn&#39;t really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he&#39;s a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5/5&#34;,
 &#39;I purchased the DVD set on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail on the head with this one. I remember watching the show when it was on TV but always wondered what happened to it. Ten years later, it\&#39;s like watching it all again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. Almost representing good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that I don\&#39;t believe were granted by anything Holy. He can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person\&#39;s emotions to change. None the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. All in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others I can think of, (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man, and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) were cancelled way before their time. The Steven King\&#39;s The Dead Zone ( Sunday\&#39;s USA Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it. There is just nothing fit to watch on TV anymore. This is because anything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from TV. So, in the meantime, I\&#39;ll just keep buying DVD sets and watching shows that should still be on TV but were booted off TV by religious zealots so we could watch &#34;quality&#34; shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).&#39;,
 &#34;One would think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, a movie should be, at the very least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, apparently I was grossly mistaken--this is single-handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny. It pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts I have had the misfortune to come across. Based solely on the big names, I remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film, but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this film, it&#39;s hard not to let loose. I can count on one hand, perhaps even two or three fingers, major Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to enjoy this---I really did. But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet. Just please don&#39;t watch this movie.&#34;,
 &#39;Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton,(Natalie),&#34;The Family Stone&#34;,\&#39;05, who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe. She always called her and told her, &#34;Surrender Dorothy&#34;, which was an expression used in the \&#39;Wizard of Oz\&#39;,1939. A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter\&#39;s friends and lovers. As Natalie investigates, the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Great film to view and enjoy, especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors.&#39;,
 &#34;I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. It&#39;s beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time. It&#39;s difficult to believe this was made in 1946, as the tale is still fresh today, and really makes one think. I&#39;m not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made. In addition, the acting is superb, and the use of English and American actors quite astounding. I recently purchased the DVD so now I&#39;m able to watch whenever I wish. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this.&#34;,
 &#34;Ringmaster, Jerry Springer&#39;s pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was made. Second of all, people went to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, i&#39;m 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had a few cool special effects) this film&#39;s moment was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that possibly could&#39;ve made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half, i&#39;ll take a dump in a can. If anyone didn&#39;t utterly despise this movie, I pity you, and your children, and your children&#39;s children&#39;s children; however, contrary to Springer&#39;s beliefs, I clearly don&#39;t condone children having sex.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear&#39;s amazing life story. Coming as it did during the Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct. As Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he&#39;s gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II, the Navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an officer&#39;s valet, the real fighting parts are denied him. That&#39;s not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once at the diving school at Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets it all thrown at him, mostly by the Master Chief Petty Officer in charge, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some leftover prejudices, but he&#39;s nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both turn out to be Men Of Honor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good performances to note are Charlize Theron as DeNiro&#39;s wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy the Navy just wish would retire for reasons you&#39;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.&#34;,
 &#39;OK, I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we decided it to watch it anyway. Just for hilarity purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I\&#39;m sorry, but this has got to be, one of THE worst films in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began off alright, and we thought &#34;Ok this might actually be OK&#34;. But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began when the &#34;mysterious paint baller&#34; turned out to be the most obvious character, the Scouser/Australian (I say that because he had an accent which couldn\&#39;t be identified), who\&#39;s acting might I just say, was abysmal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it got to the end, and by that time, we had all lost the will to live. The paint ball finals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did like about this plot is that they didn\&#39;t actually win, but annoyingly enough they won by default.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team were given was just awful. Critical Damage. I mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like &#34;The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ&#34; or something. Or that\&#39;s what the film should of been called anyway.&#39;,
 &#34;DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a tremendous surprise. It contains outstanding acting (particularly from the underrated Callan), fine cinematography and a compelling storyline. In other words, it&#39;s one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models, at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother (who happens to be missing an arm and a leg). When the models Callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film never received the praise it deserves. Most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time, but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot. It&#39;s clever and unique, which isn&#39;t something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre, but it&#39;s also passionately crafted and performed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind.&#34;,
 &#34;Horrible waste of time - bad acting, plot, directing. This is the most boring movie EVER! There are bad movies that are fun (Freddy vs. Jason), and there are bad movies that are HORRIBLE. This one fits into the latter. Bottom Line - don&#39;t waste your time.&#34;,
 &#34;A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story, it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. Of course, it happens to be haunted as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wasn&#39;t expecting the first time I saw this film is that it&#39;s one of the most touching love stories I&#39;ve ever seen; that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches. Unlike some films of Asian cinema, A Chinese Ghost Story isn&#39;t hard to swallow for those that aren&#39;t versed in Chinese culture. Indeed, it plays on timeless, cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think Evil Dead 2, if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. This film is for real, despite being overlooked by many. It&#39;s absolutely among the best I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres, and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.&#34;,
 &#39;A delight mini movie, a musical short based on three of Cole Porter\&#39;s Broadway smash songs. Bob Hope\&#39;s first credited film is a delight! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at a table of an out door café telling his friends about this beauty that takes his breath away. Suddenly he spots her a few yards away. he is so over come his friends tease him and suggest &#34;just show her your bank book.&#34; But Hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with &#34;no&#34; money! They bet polo ponies over the issue and take all his cash and ID\&#39;s. Hope follows her and when they are alone gushes out a proposal she does not believe he is sincere until he sings to her, &#34;You Do Something to Me&#34; by Cole Porter. But she must leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue her. But when she sees him showing another girl around town, disillusioned she wants to drop him. He continues to chase her and catches up to her and her family at a race track where he bets his meager earnings on the last race hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;The Case of the Scorpion\&#39;s Tail&#34; has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $1 million life insurance policy. The widow heads to Greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her. There are plenty of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow\&#39;s lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in &#34;Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key&#34; and &#34;Who Saw Her Die?&#34;) is a stunning-looking heroine. It\&#39;s one of Martino\&#39;s best films.&#39;,
 &#39;In the opening scene of &#34;Malta Story&#34; Mr A.Guinness bore such a startling resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be &#34;Certain women need striking regularly - like gongs&#34; or some such world - weary bon mot.Unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the Master would have had trouble bringing it to life.Indeed Mr Guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one.And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.Mr J.Hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a &#34;Jack Hawkins&#34; performance without an ounce of individuality.It could have been spliced from any of a dozen British war movies.Many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring London to its knees.The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the King and the island was awarded the George Cross.A worthy subject you might think for a movie,but &#34;Malta Story&#34; does not even qualify for the term &#34;worthy&#34; in its most patronising sense.It gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline,perhaps before the actors lost the will to live.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;ll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we really need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of &#34;Rocky Horror Picture Show&#34; with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. Do you think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. My big question is, what will they ruin next?&#39;,
 &#39;WOW! i didn\&#39;t know that someone would make this movie! its awful! I have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;number 1: &#34;its the biggest rave ever&#34; where is the that rave? i could only see a few people dancing around.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. when they are on the rave,they can ONLY see blood everywhere,no people,two ruined tents and one stage.. and what do they do!? they drink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.the worst actors i have ever seen! the captain and his crew.. awful! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. i didn\&#39;t knew every person in the world could fight as a pro! must be a new thing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wonder what the producer was thinking! &#34;this is going to be a big hit, its gonna be a classic&#34; .. sure u dumb s**t anyway don\&#39;t see this movie, its a waist of time. MY EYES ARE STILL BLEEDING!&#39;,
 &#34;I have seen this movie. This movie is the best according today&#39;s need. Dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays. In stating this problem this movie is the best. In this movie, the Indian values are stated very well. Today&#39;s youth must understand this problem. There is less population of girls. And due to this problem of dowry , the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there is no girl child, is not far away.So, keep in mind this statement ,today&#39;s youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriages.We have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken.And if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society. This is the major change in the society.&#34;,
 &#34;The summary line above, spoken by James Cloud (Robert Preston) to his brother Tom (Robert Sterling) just about says it all. Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he&#39;s been. Not the sort of mentoring Tom envisions for younger brother Jeff, who likes what he sees in Jim, especially when defending their ranch against local Texas cattlemen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening credits state &#39;Introducing John Barrymore Jr. as the Younger Brother&#39;, in this his very first screen appearance. That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as Jeff almost immediately into the story. Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to Sean Penn. No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family, I was left wondering if his daughter Drew Barrymore might have ever seen this picture. I&#39;m inclined to think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the subject of resemblances, I was also struck by the thought that the young Robert Sterling looked a bit like Roy Rogers early in his career. Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as George Kerby in the early 1950&#39;s TV series &#39;Topper&#39;, I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that might just be me. His character becomes emboldened by his brother&#39;s resourcefulness at creating trouble, and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story. Minor subplots abound, including the relationship rancher John Gall (John Litel) has with his son the Sheriff (who Kid Wichita kills), and the troubled marriage between Kathleen Boyce (Cathy Downs) and her husband Earl (who Kid Wichita kills). Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of Tom Cloud&#39;s hired hands, and figures in the somewhat predictable finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there, and for that reason, this Western earns points for following a less traveled, hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother/bad brother Westerns do. Combined with the eclectic casting of the principals, it&#39;s one I&#39;d recommend, even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that I experienced with my copy.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t waste time reading my review. Go out and see this astonishingly good episode, which may very well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge his murder of her daughter. Columbo is his usual rumpled, befuddled and far-cleverer-than-he-seems self, and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by heralded creators Levinson or Link yet is possibly the densest, most thoroughly original and twist-laden Columbo plot ever. Utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking. Truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all. 10/10...seek this one out on Netflix!&#34;,
 &#39;Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman:Dead End that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! This is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions &#34;other&#34; superhero related movies. Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. Finally, a Superman that actually looks &#34;super&#34; and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don\&#39;t deliver. I just wish that some sensible Warner Bros. exec gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel. I don\&#39;t care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. Hope the &#34;bigwigs&#34; at Marvel &amp; DC productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look. No more &#34;Batman &amp; Robin&#34; fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn\&#39;t be any reason to &#34;reinvent&#34; the hero for the movie, just to have it &#34;bomb&#34; in theaters. Mr. Collora...We need more directors like you!!&#39;,
 &#39;I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and never seen it again. For the life of me, I couldn\&#39;t remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking Roy Thinne\&#39;s movie credits. Excellent, dark, and spooky TV horror movie in the same class as &#34;Crowhaven Farm&#34;; &#34;Don\&#39;t Be Afraid Of The Dark&#34;; and &#34;Satan\&#39;s School for Girls&#34;, all lost Satanic classics. I also think it has many parallels to Clint Eastwood\&#39;s classic, &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34;. Why don\&#39;t they release these great little movies, especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these flicks have a cult-following, so sales shouldn\&#39;t be a problem.&#39;,
 &#34;This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn&#39;t have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*MILD SPOILERS*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother&#39;s death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*END SPOILERS*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).&#34;,
 &#34;This movie was great and I would like to buy it.The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe.The eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up. Later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer. But this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him,and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was.Please if anyone knows where I can buy this movie let me know.I haven&#39;t seen it for over 30 years,but still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com&#34;,
 &#34;When Marlene Dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like The Garden Of Allah. How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Garden Of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with Mary Anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. It then got two silent screen adaptions. The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French Tunisia to see some of what he&#39;s missed in the world. He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. She&#39;s traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman is of course Marlene and the runaway monk is Charles Boyer. I&#39;m not sure what was in David O. Selznick&#39;s mind in filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. But you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see Marlene as a modern day Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink it&#39;s economics if Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man Charles Waldron on down they&#39;ve a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. Most especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie is good for TV. I like it because I&#39;m a HUGE fan of disaster films even though this is a family film. Accuracy on the film from the book is half-and-half They got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser, the the car scene involving the Hatch family running away from the tornado wasn&#39;t in the book instead it involved Dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety. and in the book Dan and his friend are both 12-years old. Thats all i can think of. Overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book. Did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small Nebraska town in 1980?&#34;,
 &#34;I actually didn&#39;t enjoy this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it at a camp, and we didn&#39;t rave about it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book which I haven&#39;t read, but I hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). Like I said, I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well. I just really didn&#39;t like it.&#34;,
 &#39;I will be short...This film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer. The very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are &#34;treated&#34; to a lingering dance scene. The plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of BAD horror will get anything out of it. And for the love of God please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not (childish fumbling lesbians, what the hell?). this was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (that i saw anyway), someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they couldn\&#39;t take any more of it. this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy. In short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class A drugs.&#39;,
 &#39;As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of Neil Gaiman *in particular*, I\&#39;ve been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it\&#39;s finally here. And you know what? I needn\&#39;t have feared, the film version is bl**dy awesome. Different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing, and the casting in the main is a triumph, with the ghostly Princes (whose roll-call read almost as a &#34;Who\&#39;s Who&#34; of currently cool British comedy - Rupert Everett, David Walliams of Little Britain fame, two of the blokes from Green Wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films\&#39; funniest moments, which exist in abundance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the one minor criticism I have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little OTT, subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... Ricky Gervais\&#39; cameo, for example, was far too much just &#34;Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona&#34; for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness, from memory I believe the Ferdy character in the original book WAS pretty &#34;Ricky Gervais&#34;-esquire when I think back on it)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist Tristan, captures the correct mixture of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a &#34;humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest&#34;; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro, in the cameo every reviewer is talking about, is indeed deserving of praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he\&#39;s having a ball, too)... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch Lamia, my favourite performance of the film overall. If you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent &#34;Hairspray&#34; then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass \&#39;n smarts than is immediately apparent. One of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as The Princess Bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come.&#39;,
 &#34;This very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget. Dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid, chase scenes are uniformly boring, and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film&#39;s last five minutes (a briefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film&#39;s chief villain--no prop is here without a purpose). The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of Rodger Corman&#39;s studio when he&#39;d give a first time director a few bucks and a camera--but without the discipline Corman would impose.&#34;,
 &#39;What\&#39;s this? A Canadian produced zombie flick that I have never heard of before. A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there. Basically, he and friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting. Cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner (who gets his eyes popped out). The final WTF? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming, &#34;I\&#39;m not crazy!&#34; Amazingly, he has his eyeballs back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running a scant 58 minutes, this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema. It feels a lot longer, but put me in some kind of trance where I couldn\&#39;t stop watching. The film also has one of those &#34;if you see this image, turn away from the screen&#34; gags. It is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater (prophetic?) and when he pops up (only twice) the blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period. There is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl\&#39;s right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on - it is a left hand.&#39;,
 &#39;Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the 80\&#39;s culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of &#34;evil&#34; Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing his latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh*t helping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it\&#39;s pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It\&#39;s got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere... All in all, it\&#39;s actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this &#34;uber-evil&#34; Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the &#34;Metal&#34; is little more than putrid 80\&#39;s Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the cliché\&#39;s here, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming &#34;Rock and Roll!!!&#34; in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond retch. Aside from that atrocious musical representation, it\&#39;s actually pretty good. 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.ResidentHazard.com&#39;,
 &#34;Could anyone please stop John Carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation? How low can you go? It seems this man has lost any self respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This episode looks like it has been done by a film student, it isn&#39;t even worth beginning to talk about WHAT was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please retire immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from Escape from L.A. to Ghosts of Mars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get drunk instead.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it. Now don&#39;t get me wrong here either, I&#39;m not a total philistine, I didn&#39;t hate the movie because it wasn&#39;t enough like &#39;police academy 9&#39; or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Magnolia&#39; is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There&#39;s some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it&#39;s his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail&#39;s pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn&#39;t think so, but I don&#39;t like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack&#39;s dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of &#39;Friends&#39; whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.&#34;,
 &#39;Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990\&#39;s and see how vapid they were for the most part, and how Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, &#34;Zentropa&#34; (or &#34;Europa&#34; as it is referred to outside the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post WWII Europe, namely the decimated German landscape, whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people. Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen. You will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940\&#39;s with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes, while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge, especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, Von Trier got caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this. And while his &#34;Breaking the Waves&#34; and &#34;Dancer in the Dark&#34; are classics in their own right, it is with &#34;Zentropa&#34; that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like a fine wine, and begs for a DVD release.&#39;,
 &#39;First time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but reviewed now this thriller is still actual. Some newer movies focus on similar topics, but they do not match this french milestone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A president - obviously JF Kennedy - gets shot in an open car during a public appearance. The resulting huge investigation finds the &#34;Lee Harvey Oswald&#34; figure of this movie guilty, but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry. He reveals some surprising evidence ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Oliver Stone\&#39;s JFK - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions, but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing a new picture of the assassination. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. Parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies, I had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I... comme Icare&#34; is a &#34;must see&#34;. Its unique and brilliant, and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good ranking, if it was a Hollywood production it would be famous for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat down to watch this, I was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were, this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones. Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I watched the first ten minutes of it, I was actually really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it\&#39;ll improve. It didn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this just a dire film by itself, it didn\&#39;t need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back!? The acting in it was TERRIBLE, the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well. The way they made Springwood was just totally wrong. Pays no respect to the first one at-all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are saying that this film was &#34;funny&#34;. This film is not &#34;funny&#34; at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be &#34;funny&#34;? I would call it funnily crap. This film is supposed to be a Horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, wouldn\&#39;t that information have surfaced like in the first one!? The ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy, exactly like the rest of it. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. Just shows itself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good in the beginning, yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin. They shouldn\&#39;t have even bothered making this film. Nor any of the other sequels, except the third one. The third one\&#39;s the only decent one out of all the sequels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was a DVD by itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have chucked it out when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a complete MOCKERY of the first film &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please, don\&#39;t waste your time on this worthless junk.&#39;,
 &#39;I have just managed to get hold of the Celestial region 3 DVD of The Five Venoms and what a super job they have made of it. A fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any Kung Fu fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is pretty straight forward, and has been mentioned already so I won\&#39;t go into it again. Needless to say it\&#39;s the fight scenes that many buy the movie for, and they do not disappoint. Only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed. Bruce Lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with the all important &#34;type writer&#34; clicks and air &#34;whooshes&#34;, which is a cool effect though quite amusing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this movie a B+. Good but not great. In a way I feel it could have been that bit better. Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had as good a story and better action.&#39;,
 &#39;Whatever his name is (the writer and director) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again. This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they\&#39;re actually sort of good. Not this one. This was so bad I got angry. Seriously. A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all, the CGI was barely acceptable, the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was, it\&#39;s like he just decided, &#34;I want this to happen and this to happen, but I don\&#39;t care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever, I\&#39;m going back to my trailer to pick my nose, if anyone calls for me, I\&#39;m not here.&#34; Shame on you whatever your name is. Shame on you.&#39;,
 &#39;Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80\&#39;s exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we\&#39;re dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we\&#39;re up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister\&#39;s naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn\&#39;t mind at all. Sick, dude! Anyway, as kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers. When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they\&#39;re facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of &#34;White Fire&#34;, but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. Most of the time you have no clue who\&#39;s beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly \x96 and I won\&#39;t reveal for what reason \x96 Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes. Bo\&#39;s principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there\&#39;s the obligatory &#34;we\&#39;re-falling-in-love&#34; montage and loads of other attractions! My God, what a brilliant experience. The original French title translates itself as &#34;Life to Survive&#34;, which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: None!&#39;,
 &#39;Flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flick exposes all the clichés, and then some! Excruciatingly bad (Downs-Syndrome!) actors. Terribly heavy self important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It achieves exactly what it was designed to. A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they\&#39;ve been doing for the last two years! After &#34;What Is It?&#34; received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.&#39;,
 &#34;Way back when I was renting videos for free I picked this one up. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was gross and unecessary. 2: There is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way I felt for days after viewing this trash I figure they had something subliminal going on in the track. Either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. Many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent. And don&#39;t even ask about the acting.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie is about sexual obsession. Bette Davis plays Mildred. This is a woman who men are drawn to. Not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity. Now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious. There is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. She works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can&#39;t read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. It is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. One day Phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. He dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. He is constantly thinking about her. His med school grades are even failing. So what the nookie is too good. He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. She always lets Phil know she really doesn&#39;t have love feelings for him all of time. He is heart broken but he meets another woman. They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo. Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. Phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. She does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn&#39;t work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. Oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. He meets another girl named Sally we have a March of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for Mildred. Well he has no school tuition, can&#39;t find a job. Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill. Soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again. She has TB. meanwhile he is still leading Sally down the Primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. Finally the bimbo dies and Phillip declares he is free now and he will marry Sally. I wished she told him to stuff it. Now I know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. But I feel Phillip was the bad guy. Yes Mildred is a Strumpet BUT he knows it, and he keeps coming back. Mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. I guess the sex wasn&#39;t as good. But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred. Not only that but the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married and when Philip asks him what he intends to do about Baby ( apparently the baby&#39;s name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and Baby and he is wealthy. Sally&#39;s father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. Philip doesn&#39;t seem to refute his feelings either. Men are using Mildred as a Boy Toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. To me it is Philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for Mildred.&#34;,
 &#34;This rubbish excuse for television is the single most god-awful piece of trash ever to hit Australian television. The house-mates are dull, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them. As far as I am concerned Big Brother is the decline of western society, showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain-dead morons. Whatever happened to television that didn&#39;t target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This cannot be classified as entertainment. I think that it true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedian and, once moving to Channel 10, become horribly unfunny. With the exception of The Simpsons which is highly intelligently made.&#34;,
 &#34;Interesting to read comments by viewers regarding Omega Code... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from TBN broadcasts... the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video, to be stocked besides the three-part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s.. dont remember it? You wont remember this one either in a year or two. This is the first movie I have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls... very shameful... this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist&#39;s son, you too can play high-roller Hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money...&#34;,
 &#34;Have to admit, this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront! None can act except the nurse who was my fav! Juliet had good skills as a teen but she can&#39;t give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her. She&#39;s worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion...god stop whining! I would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrews...yikes! Considering his other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he&#39;s quite a shocker in this one. And don&#39;t get me started on Romeo...puhleasssssee! It&#39;s still good to see if you&#39;re on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of film. Olivia and Leonard&#39;s version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard&#39;s version and then the current Leo and Clare!&#34;,
 &#34;Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Set in Partition India, this film Shows the true reality of partition India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go. Her freedom, personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor. There several moments in the film where one is brought to tears. The film at points is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are spine chilling, yet Urmila&#39;s endurance and survival are both remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling.&#34;,
 &#34;I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this film was touted) but this one failed me miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I rapidly lost interest. I feel so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie. I&#39;ll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one. The one thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played Yonica&#39;s character so well that I didn&#39;t even recognize Hillary; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $1 through Red Box; had I paid to see it in on the big screen, I would be really fuming!!&#34;,
 &#39;For anyone craving a remake of 1989\&#39;s Slaves of New York. What are there, seven of you? Here it is... was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (Well they\&#39;re club-kids, ya big jerk!) that are in holding patterns. The big question seems to be, just how long can a young adult remain juvenile? It took three people to write this \&#39;story\&#39;? Good god, it was easier to come up with Citizen Kane. Rather than take viewers back, this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-somethings could imagine it. The odd sidebar about library work is not the sub-plot one expects from the equivalent of Parker Posey\&#39;s Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. Her &#34;I\&#39;m serious about graduate school!&#34; while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical. Posey\&#39;s shtick is always amusing, but there are projects that are beneath her. I was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;The Second Coming Of Suzanne&#34; is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated, yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other movies of this type, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot. However, the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video box states that this film is &#34;one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film.&#34; Yeah...sure. It\&#39;s right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile. 1/10&#39;,
 &#34;Erotic cinema of the 1970&#39;s was tame compared to the triple X romps of today, which is good. Because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little. Plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods, but it&#39;s worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled THE DEVIL&#39;S PLAYTHING. But if you don&#39;t care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex, then this isn&#39;t the movie for you. However, I did enjoy it and I give it...7 STARS.&#34;,
 &#34;They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character. This of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on now , couldn&#39;t they have shown us just one of the death scenes? We hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don&#39;t get to see anything. Some how I Bury The Living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better I movie , such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Proximity&#34; tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This very ordinary film is an action/drama with a weak plot; stereotypical, poorly developed characters; and a one dimensional performance by Lowe. A forgettable film not worthy of further commentary.&#39;,
 &#34;An interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne as America&#39;s first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry&#39;s gunboat diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period. Altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.&#34;,
 &#39;I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning. It is wonderfully thought up, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unbelievable on how much TV has been needing a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It is a huge relief to see a show, that is unlike the rest, where as, if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities, and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by-far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a very good movie, not only for the fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated movies/series of adventure and fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn&#39;t done, but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she seeks revenge...and the rest you better see it from the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the movie a lot, the characters are like the original comics, form Chaos. I never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics, only the last ones, after the passages in the movie, so I cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics, but...one way or another it&#39;s the story of Lady Death!&#34;,
 &#34;I thought this movie did a down right good job. It wasn&#39;t as creative or original as the first, but who was expecting it to be. It was a whole lotta fun. the more i think about it the more i like it, and when it comes out on DVD I&#39;m going to pay the money for it very proudly, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible(Catwoman), but this movie isn&#39;t, this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime, and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs. Don&#39;t wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Don&#39;t expect a masterpiece, or something thats gripping and soul touching, just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven&#39;t seen it see it, because what the critics and box office say doesn&#39;t always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you might just enjoy it. I tip my hat to this movie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#34;,
 &#39;Wow... 5 more hours of Riget. Lars continues the great combination of occult, dark horror and soap-opera drama. Picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off(complete with the same high intensity and suspense, though that doesn\&#39;t last; for better or worse), this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste... in the last series, there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode, whereas in this, it clearly is one long stretch... where one episode ends, the next begins. A lot can be said about Lars von Trier... but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric. Both qualities show in this. The plot continues its excellence, now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention. Basically every character from the first returns, at least as far as the main roles go. The pacing isn\&#39;t as sharp as in the first part, and I found myself less gripped by this one. That is not in any kind of way to say that this didn\&#39;t involve me, though... I still found myself constantly watching, and at several points reacting strongly, often out loud, to what was going on(extremely unusual behavior for me, as I am an incredibly silent person), as I also was during the first. Like the first, this also brings up some loaded ethical questions. Building on the foundation from the first, this brings the story further... and being a sequel, the scope is also bigger. Grander. More spirits, more bizarre occurrences, more subplots. The strong graphic material of the first also returns, and it\&#39;s been kicked up a notch. The characters are developed further. The acting is amazing, as that of the first. Udo Kier solidifies his immense talent, to anyone who doubted it. Playing a very difficult character(anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what I mean) *and* acting in a language he didn\&#39;t speak(he was later dubbed)... and still handing in such a strong performance. The cinematography remains great, and is still very hand-held, with rapid zooms and the occasional long take. The editing is sharp, with a few direct cuts in sound(though these were more prominent in the first). Now, with all that said, I would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10... or at least just under, like the first four episodes. I truly enjoyed watching, and I don\&#39;t regret it in the least. But this does have shortcomings... the ones the first part had and more. As the first, the humor just takes up too much space... and this time around, it\&#39;s even worse. There are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief... three of them, no less. Scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh. Fine for a comedy, but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant, yes, nothing short of sadistic at times, horror piece? Helmer\&#39;s solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof... from which he could see his beloved Sweden... to a bathroom. With an angle from inside the bowl. No, you read that right. In general, the humor seems more low-brow... more sex and bodily function jokes, which, again, begs the question &#34;Why?&#34;. Whilst most of the writing is excellent, some of it is downright dire. Several scenes are basically copied from the first mini-series(one would guess due to their popularity when it aired). At times, the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first, and it jumps too much at times. Fortunately seldom, but still noticeably, plot points and items are explained away too easily(a certain character living in Denmark for no apparent reason, for example... anyone who\&#39;s seen it knows who I\&#39;m speaking of). The two dishwashers, while still mysterious and insightful, become too much of a gimmick... too overexposed, in the end, I guess. Most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable, though. In addition to that, I want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things I have just written that this is still mostly good... definitely enjoyable, compelling, powerful... and in my humble opinion, it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first(though if belong in that group; do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first). I recommend this to any fan of Lars von Trier and anyone who enjoyed the first Riget and wants more where that came from. I urge anyone who\&#39;s even considering watching this to make sure you\&#39;ve seen all of the first before you do... I bought this before I bought the first, but I held out on watching until I had bought the first and watched that, and I can\&#39;t tell you how glad I am that I did. Though this features a brief summary of the events in the first, there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn\&#39;t see it before watching this. Slightly lesser sequel, but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first. 8/10&#39;,
 &#34;As a kid, my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody movie ever made. I&#39;m not sure who started that rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren&#39;t allowed to see it for one reason or other. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a perennial late night cable movie, and as a result, I&#39;ve been able to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times, and I can always spot it from 1-2 seconds of screen time. However, aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the stiff dialog, and the outrageously difficult story-line, the film has some things going for it. With all that&#39;s bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually pretty entertaining. Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume! The canned kung-fu sounds are cheeky, but the slowed and pitched-down music, and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird. The chase through the city of demented, blood-thirsty villagers isn&#39;t really tense as much as it is irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train-wreck a little fun. Could it be headed for cult-classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?&#34;,
 &#39;Now, I\&#39;m one to watch movies that got poor reviews, and say, &#34;Hmm... this isn\&#39;t so bad!&#34; I loved The Cable Guy, and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind, I really didn\&#39;t start watching this with high hopes, but I figured that maybe... just maybe... it would be bad in a kind of way I could laugh at it. I was wrong. At no point at all during my suffering through this &#34;film&#34; (And I use that term sparingly) was I even close to being mildly entertained. To start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could tell, an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him. The main character is simply annoying, and not a character that it\&#39;s easy to like. Quite frankly, I would rather eat a greasy turd out of a Harlequin fetus\&#39; bloody sores than watch this again.&#39;,
 &#39;Beautiful to watch, but what would be the first thing you would do the moment YOU discovered Atlantis? Explore it! Here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special. Instead, Disney reverted to the same old formula story telling.&#39;,
 &#39;This is one of the best Hong Kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. This Sammo film has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well. It is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. Sammo fans- This is a must see (See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.&#39;,
 &#34;Aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot, this movie wasn&#39;t too bad. Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t leave much movie not to suck. Do not waste your time on this film, even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia, as I did. Watch an infomercial instead.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and funny. To say anything else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and sub plots in the movie. This movie has ensemble cast with today&#39;s hottest stars. They all gives over the top performances. This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera!!!If you watch soap go check this movie it&#39;s hilarious!!!&#34;,
 &#39;Why the crap is this movie rated so low?! I\&#39;ve seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY line to this movie. It\&#39;s obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop &#34;Airman&#34; Cooper, and Doug Remer, or &#34;Sir Swish.&#34; Mainly they\&#39;re just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called &#34;Townsell.&#34; I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: &#34;And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I\&#39;m happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami.&#34; His agent leans over: &#34;Minnesota.&#34; Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with zany blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it\&#39;ll leave you crying for more. Watch it dude, it\&#39;s hilarious.&#39;,
 &#34;When I was younger, I liked this show, but now...BLECCH!!! This show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. The three leads were all good actors and funny men (Saget&#39;s stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was Coulier a better stand up, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). The show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The catch phrases- How many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with &#39;how rude&#39;, &#39;you got it dude&#39;, &#39;nerdbomber&#39;, &#39;cut it out&#39; and &#39;have mercy&#39; in a 24 hour time period? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Kimmy Gibler- the most annoying character ever written for television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The writing- stale and cliched as an oreo cookie. There is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. Full House had bad cliched writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Three men living together in San Francisco- Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Unrealistic stuff- Too much to recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Trendy kids- The girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just so sugary sweet, I couldn&#39;t stand it after a while.&#34;,
 &#39;My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me obtain this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL&#39;,
 &#39;Soldier Blue is a movie with pretensions: pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man\&#39;s inhumanity to man, on the white man\&#39;s exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things. What Soldier Blue actually is is pernicious, trite, badly made, dishonest rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies. What it is basically is a lame, clichéd, poorly acted &#34;odd couple&#34; romance - Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other\&#39;s lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn\&#39;t have been out of place in a Lucio Fulci splatter flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, gore-drenched climax, in which cute little native American children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up, and large-breasted native American women are molested, raped and strung up - no excuse, that is, except box office. (The massacre itself, whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention, is very badly staged and shot; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments, incidentally, which utilised real amputees in their filming. Now that\&#39;s what I call exploitation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget all the pap you\&#39;ve heard (including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie) about this being a &#34;protest&#34;, an indictment of American brutality towards the native peoples. This film doesn\&#39;t give a stuff about the plight of the Cheyenne; had it done so it would have featured some involving native American characters, would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless, faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax. Instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss (lousy actors both, in this at least), with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is a terrible shame, because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all of the real life massacres the US (and Britain, and all so-called &#34;civilised&#34; nations) have participated in over the centuries (Iraq?). this just isn\&#39;t that movie.&#39;,
 &#34;A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one. Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O&#39;Hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of the hit-man&#39;s assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle&#39;s possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata&#39;s maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but O&#39;Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. Released upon a Fremantle DVD, this largely lustreless affair depicting a man &#39;neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.&#34;,
 &#39;The wife and I saw a preview of this movie while watching another DVD and thought &#34;Jon Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach, it\&#39;s gotta be better than summer reruns, so I ordered it from local library. Well, any episode of &#34;Lawrence Welk&#34; would bring more laughs than &#34;Mama\&#39;s Boy&#34;. I actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and I couldn\&#39;t imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera. Perhaps, at least, maybe next time they\&#39;re offered a movie of this sort, they\&#39;ll &#34;Just Say No!\&#39; A one anna two....&#39;,
 &#34;This film could have been a silent movie; it certainly has the feel of one. I was extremely, extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film. Extase, is a &#39;symphony of love&#39;, and transcends all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version.A young Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen, in this film which, in a way is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic.Tech qualities may have been a little crude; but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudes.Many lovers of early cinema, would absolutely adore this film.&#34;,
 &#39;I imagine Victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past, pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts. Along comes television: at its best, it has a redemptive power, and with dramatisations like those the BBC produce so finely, Victorian literature gets a new stab at life. The religious themes, the moral overtones, may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked, and acquainted with cohabitation, affairs and domestic violence. But those old, well-told stories have enduring power, and this is one\&#39;s a hidden gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s hard to gauge today just how forceful, feminist and extraordinary Ann Bronte\&#39;s masterpiece, &#34;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&#34;, actually was. Emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets \x96 bodily, mental, societal \x96 her heroine, Helen Huntingdon, escapes a miserable marriage, flees brutality and alcoholism, braves not only her abusive husband\&#39;s fury, but society\&#39;s pinched intolerance and malicious gossip, to wreak change in her life. She pays a price; but retains her self-respect; she falls in love along the way; she emerges battered but victorious, and strong. I just love watching women like these on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors are superb \x96 the best Brits have to offer. The love story is beautifully handled, with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors. Tara Fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine, and as has been said here by other reviewers, no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle. Toby Stephens, striking sparks off her, contributes just the right combination of headstrong, handsome youth and passionate, yearning vulnerability. Rupert Graves (one of my favourite British actors ever) enjoys himself as the charismatic villain (so much so that you\&#39;re almost with him at the end. No one\&#39;s perfect). The supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes, and without having felt preached to. Another BBC classic, highly recommended: this is how romantic literature should be dramatised.&#39;,
 &#34;My first child was born the year this program came out, and I played the record album for the boys every Christmas thereafter. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families...it invariably becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVD&#39;s (made on DVD-R from video tapes, probably) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and DVD will stay in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.&#34;,
 &#39;Do not expect a depiction of the &#34;truth&#34;. However, the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi &amp; Afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military\&#39;s and Veterans Affairs\&#39; programs for helping those who\&#39;ve suffered and still suffer the traumas of war. These are NOT fatal flaws of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a veteran myself, I know that the horrible aftermath of war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.&#39;,
 &#34;To be a Buster Keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis. Most of us first encounter Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production: &#39;The General&#39;, &#39;The Navigator&#39;, &#39;Sherlock Jnr&#39;. We recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy, and we want to see more of his movies. Here the heartbreak begins. After &#39;Steamboat Bill Jnr&#39;, Keaton&#39;s brother-in-law Joseph Schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put Keaton under the control of MGM. Keaton became just one more actor for hire, performing someone else&#39;s scripts. Then his alcoholism got worse. After &#39;Steamboat Bill Jnr&#39;, Keaton never again made a truly first-rate film. A couple of sources describe a would-be masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed he *almost* got to make at MGM: a parody of &#39;Grand Hotel&#39;. Biographer Tom Dardis has offered convincing evidence that Keaton made up this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heartbreak increases because, among the many years of Keaton&#39;s long steady decline, he just occasionally came up with a good film ... such as his short comedy &#39;Grand Slam Opera&#39;. I continue to search for the lost footage of Keaton&#39;s dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in &#39;It&#39;s a Mad Mad World&#39;: a sequence in which embittered cop Tracy telephones an old retired crook (Keaton) and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing Smiler Grogan&#39;s cash. That footage is almost certainly gone forever, but I keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Speak Easily&#39;, alas, is one of Keaton&#39;s films from the beginning of his decline. MGM were trying to build up Jimmy Durante (who, coincidentally, played Smiler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to build up Durante by teaming him with Keaton, whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with Durante&#39;s. (I&#39;m a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durante was a merciless scene-stealer: commendably, he knew that he was being built up at Keaton&#39;s expense, and Keaton was the only co-star whom Durante never attempted to upstage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations. In &#39;Speak Easily&#39;, he plays a didactic and humourless Midwestern college professor named Post (because he&#39;s as wooden as one) who receives a letter informing him that he&#39;s inherited $750,000, which he must travel to New York City to claim. Does he make a &#39;phone call to verify this? Does he even check the postmark? No; he takes his life&#39;s savings out of the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he&#39;s gone, Post&#39;s manservant confesses that he wrote the (fake) letter to jostle Professor Post out of his rut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post, who thinks he&#39;s a 3/4-millionaire, crosses paths with Jimmy Dodge (Durante), who&#39;s trying to produce a musical revue but hasn&#39;t any money. The characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh. Keaton is playing one of those eggheads (like Mister Logic in &#39;Viz&#39;) who intellectualises everything. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang. There&#39;s a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about money, but - instead of coming straight out with it - Durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like &#39;kale&#39;, &#39;cartwheels&#39; and so forth ... while Keaton of course has no idea what Durante&#39;s on about. I&#39;ll give Keaton credit: his own dry and dusty prairie voice, his flat Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he&#39;s playing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidney Toler, looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later, is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled (on tick) by Professor Post. Henry Armetta, whom I&#39;ve never found funny, is even less funny than usual here, offering a running gag with a stupid payoff. Thelma Todd impressed me here, in a more villainous version of the role she played in &#39;Horse Feathers&#39; (a much funnier movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favourite character actors, is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the problem with &#39;Speak Easily&#39; is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways. Keaton&#39;s lawyer shows up at Durante&#39;s theatre with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he isn&#39;t there, so the lawyer proceeds to divulge Keaton&#39;s personal business to the first total stranger he meets. (Fire that lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - the guy who&#39;s perceived as bankrolling this musical - blunders into the chorus girls&#39; changing room, and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves. I know for a fact that *modern* chorus girls would never react this way, and I seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either ... certainly not in response to the &#39;angel&#39; controlling their show&#39;s pursestrings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS COMING. About half an hour into the unfunny &#39;Speak Easily&#39;, the great Jimmy Durante seats himself at the piano, grins into the camera, and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune. This is the moment when I thought that, at long last, this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us. Alas, no. Most annoying of all is the ending of this film, which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy: the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude. (Keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of &#39;Screen Directors Playhouse&#39;; Chaplin had already used it in &#39;The Circus&#39;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very nearly wept - in anger and sorrow - at the wasted opportunities in &#39;Speak Easily&#39;. Mostly out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I&#39;ll rate this movie 2 points out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;This movie, even though is about one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers producers: the extreme life in our cities, has a funny way to put it on the screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four of the more important Mexican directors, of the last times, approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire, which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country, but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With actors little known, but that interprets of excellent way their paper, each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world, that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness. Perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased, but I consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the Mexican.&#39;,
 &#39;There\&#39;s the danger with the critic/philosopher Slavoj Zizek with his film, directed by Sophie Fiennes, which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr Freudian comparisons to overload. But in the Pervert\&#39;s Guide to Cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis I\&#39;ve seen on a collective section of films. While it doesn\&#39;t cover the expansive territory Scorsese\&#39;s movie documentaries cover, the same attachments are there, and Zizek has a definite love for all of these &#34;perverse&#34; examples and films, primarily the work of Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky. Yet one shouldn\&#39;t go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, I got to see it almost by luck- thinking Zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner. If anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the Marx brothers as representations of the Id, Super-Ego and Ego (Harpo\&#39;s example is most dead-on for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He\&#39;s not just one to take on the classics though, he also considers the food for thought in The Matrix and Fight Club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former, and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one\&#39;s own self as well as ones double in the latter. He even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children\&#39;s births happens elsewhere. The ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point Zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare\&#39;s creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with Vertigo. This too goes for a scene that Zizek deconstructs as if it\&#39;s the Zapruder film, where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the \&#39;don\&#39;t you look at me\&#39; scene in Blue Velvet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it would be one thing if Zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as Scorsese does. But he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters (i.e. Lost Highway) by putting himself IN the locations the films take place in. Funniest is first seeing him in the boat &#34;heading&#34; towards the same dock Tippi Hedren\&#39;s boat heads to at the beginning of the Birds; equally funny is as he waters the Blue Velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of Frank Booth; only one, when he\&#39;s in Solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy. But Zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up, and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and Zizek\&#39;s words come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some films I of course would\&#39;ve expected, chiefly from Hitchcock and Lynch, but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the Pervert\&#39;s Guide of Cinema (top two for me would be the Disney Pluto cartoon and the exposition on Chaplin\&#39;s films, albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of \&#39;voice\&#39;), and the ones that one hasn\&#39;t seen yet (i.e. the ventriloquist horror film, Dr. Mabuse, Stalker, among a few others) that inspire immediate feelings of \&#39;wow, I have to see that immediately, no questions asked.\&#39; Zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet. It\&#39;s probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how Freud works its way into films regarding desire, the Id/Super-Ego/Ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never see...unless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels.&#39;,
 &#34;Carla works for a property developer&#39;s where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. She is also deaf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company. Help arrives in the form of Paul, a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul&#39;s criminality by having him steal the contract back. The colleague quickly realises that she&#39;s behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul&#39;s readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul is given a &#39;going over&#39; by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan which utilises Carla&#39;s unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. It&#39;s now Carla&#39;s turn to enter a frightening new world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard, &#39;READ MY LIPS&#39; begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. Carla&#39;s first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he&#39;s receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many French films, &#39;READ MY LIPS&#39; appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it&#39;s probably about everything. The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul&#39;s parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the French &#39;New Wave&#39; of the 60&#39;s that first introduced the concept of &#39;genre&#39; to film making and I&#39;ve always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it&#39;s always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.&#34;,
 &#34;When Sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12, and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird predicaments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always one of my favourite programmes, the witchy feeling of sixties sitcom &#39;Bewitched&#39; but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch. The characters at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fave, shame he left so early on) Hilda and Zelda her aunts started off OK, but then became irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked Mr. Kraft too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering Sabrina&#39;s secret. What i loved about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable. Too many characters came and left, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad and then they decided to do Sabrina at college which ruined it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina became self-absorbed at college, there was less magic, no spell book, no aunts living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last series was boring, and i only watched to see what happened in the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong somehow and Miles was gone just like that. The last episode made me feel a lot better though (SPOILER)having Sabrina end up with Harvey on her wedding day to dullard Aaron was great! Overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows. Magical.&#34;,
 &#34;While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I&#39;m not even sure where to begin as I&#39;ve got so many problems with this movie. I suppose I&#39;ll just number a few of them: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Acting \x96 When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you&#39;re in trouble? Not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly A-List names. Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I&#39;ve never considered her the greatest actress I&#39;ve ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less said the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Ghosts \x96 The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at Disney World. And, they are about as frightening. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Plot \x96 How predictable can one movie be? The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. If you couldn&#39;t see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Convenient Priest \x96 What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Everything Else \x96 It&#39;s very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. I suppose I&#39;ll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house&#39;s architecture. That&#39;s a sure sign of a winner \x96 noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn&#39;t say much about the actual movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll stop. You should be able to get the idea from what I&#39;ve already mentioned. And, I haven&#39;t even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems. Be warned, this thing is horrible.&#34;,
 &#39;Basically the exact same movie as &#34;House of Wax&#34; - Vincent Price\&#39;s first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because &#34;The Mad Magician&#34; offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-D effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! &#34;Never change a winning team&#34; is exactly what writer Crane Wilbur must have thought when he penned down Price\&#39;s character Don Gallico, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. Don Gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as Gallico the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled &#34;The Girl and the Buzz Saw&#34;. Gallico\&#39;s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer Ross Ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of Gallico\&#39;s inventions are the rightful property of the company. The sleazy and relentless Ormond, who by the way also ransacked Gallico\&#39;s once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of Gallico\&#39;s rival The Great Rinaldi. Inevitably Gallico snaps and sadistically butchers Ormond, but \x96 also being a master of creating disguises \x96 recreates his victim\&#39;s image and even starts leading a double life. &#34;The Mad Magician&#34; is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50\&#39;s horror movie in Grand Guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). The 3-D delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50\&#39;s hype, but it\&#39;s still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. &#34;The Mad Magician&#34; is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of Alice Prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. Needless to state that Vincent Price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. Like no other actor could ever accomplish, Price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. You pity Don Gallico, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. You support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. Vincent Price simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.&#39;,
 &#34;So this guy named George is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up. George&#39;s wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away George gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls. It isn&#39;t that great of a scene because it really doesn&#39;t show anything. After that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house. They make him a nice breakfast but George isn&#39;t hungry. George isn&#39;t very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house. The girls have had enough with old George and no longer want to cook for them. They both turn out to be major psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up George&#39;s house. George wasn&#39;t really that great to his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he really didn&#39;t seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker on Family Guy. I was for the two girls the whole time.&#34;,
 &#34;This is a pleasant film, even if the premise is silly. It was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano). That&#39;s what makes her a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, had that ability, too, and he really puts himself into the role, making an amusing, good-hearted Einstein. I suppose you could say they&#39;re both good at portraying loveable characters, though loveable in different ways (loveable young women vs. loveable curmudgeon).&#34;,
 &#39;The movie was much better than the other reviewer stated. It\&#39;s a nice family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl\&#39;s family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and it\&#39;s pretty much PG or G rated. I\&#39;m an adult who can appreciate a nice &#34;family&#34; movie - I guess the other reviewer isn\&#39;t.&#39;,
 &#34;This is possibly the best short crime drama I&#39;ve ever seen. The acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who&#39;s character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does an amazing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who&#39;s lost a child, its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. The other actors are of course great too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I&#39;m not going to give away,is fantastic mainly because you don&#39;t really get one... (you&#39;ll get what I mean after you&#39;ve seen it) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you&#39;re not touched by this you&#39;re one cold hearted person.&#34;,
 &#39;I think the biggest disappointment in this film was that, right until the end, I expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was. When you consider the powerful subject, the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a shame that little attention was given to acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;The Finnish version of Robert Altman\&#39;s &#34;Short Cuts&#34;, set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the &#34;routines&#34; of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). Compared with Altman\&#39;s classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.&#39;,
 &#34;Hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest, though the audience sees he is a werewolf. The hunters never seem to realize this, because after they shoot him, he looks normal when they decapitate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A doctor transplants the werewolf&#39;s eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, gets to have sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even gets his bandages removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After he leaves the hospital, he finds his wife has been cheating on him too. When a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon (with a fake tree branch on the foreground), he turns into a werewolf! His torso grows larger, splitting his shirt, and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes. His pants stay intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, though some sort of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a fair amount of blood and gore, and those are fairly well done. There&#39;s even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie. However, when a man falls from a height, a rather bad dummy does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is some sort of occult expert, and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named Androse who is also such an expert. They try to help him a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich kills people who have done him wrong. A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on Beaton, who doesn&#39;t much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite cheap, but between the nudity and blood and gore, and a not-terrible story combining (sort of) The Most Dangerous Game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man, it&#39;s somewhat entertaining. Available on its own, or in the box set Scream Queens Vol. 1.&#34;,
 &#39;This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus. Suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Cabin Fever&#34; is a horrible film. For one, it tries to be many genres at once. Is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody can tell. There\&#39;s a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. I liked the ending a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But apart from the ending, I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. The violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What are we supposed to get from that? This same girl would bite one of the characters. Was that supposed to be funny? I don\&#39;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. I didn\&#39;t care for most of the characters. I liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. As a horror film, I didn\&#39;t know what it was trying to be. I didn\&#39;t find it funny, tense, nor scary. By the end, you\&#39;re left indifferent, thinking, &#34;What have I just been through?&#34; Unfortunately, you\&#39;ll never know the answer to that question.&#39;,
 &#34;Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! De Niro&#39;s psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90&#39;s movie psycho killer. The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies. One of my most horrible movie experiences. Rent the original it&#39;s 100 times better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#34;Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and clever dialogue and an eye-pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting. Dana Andrews stars as Detective Mark Dixon, part mobster and part cop, who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals. After one case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets far more involved than he wanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana Andrews is terrific in his role - tough and edgy, Andrews&#39; Dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side. He&#39;s the perfect film noir anti-hero - he&#39;s not very nice all the time, but we still root for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. There might not be too much to Tierney&#39;s role, but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role, knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile, gentle manner, and twinkle in her eye. The supporting cast isn&#39;t too bad either - Karl Malden being the most memorable, stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is no Laura, but it is a great film noir filled with great characters, story, and picture.&#34;,
 &#39;Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography i think not. This movie wasn\&#39;t too terrible but it wasn\&#39;t that much better than average. The main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was... should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically &#34;because mom says we can\&#39;t.&#34; Some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters. Couple times i was wondering if the writer/director was a fan of George Lucas\&#39; classic American Graffiti. Not that it\&#39;s wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that, i mean come on! Worst part of this was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, i mean double come on!! She was the only one, in one or two lines, who actually tried a southern accent. (Take a good listen, it was there even though her character was from California! DOH!!) Maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie. Oh well, what can ya do when you have a director who\&#39;s just a director and not an artist, also. Too bad. Overall i give this a B- and that\&#39;s being a little generous \&#39;cause i\&#39;m partial to Ms. Amick.&#39;,
 &#39;I had never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD rental outlet mentioned it to me; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the U.K., I decided to check it out. The film turned out be a dull, amateurish and ugly-looking ride; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time, whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s worse, the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings. Soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again; another, still bed-ridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a bible-thumping mother (cue horrendous overacting), her repressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother (as a means of filling in the dreary, to say nothing of unoriginal, backstory) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests, the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time...&#39;,
 &#39;Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. One day, a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters won\&#39;t let her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is off to the ball, with the warning to return home by midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince later get married, and they live happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success, and it continues to charm audiences to this day. It has a well-written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including &#34;A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes&#34;, &#34;So This Is Love&#34;, and the great &#34;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&#34;, help tell the story. This was my favorite movie growing up, and it hasn\&#39;t lost any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this film, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs, and a restored print of the movie!&#39;,
 &#34;i really in enjoyed watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn&#39;t sure that i was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with comedic moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie. this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with in the black community. i do think that it is worth a chance. if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn&#39;t for you&#34;,
 &#34;Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise this would get an easy zero. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact were Peckenpah&#39;s name not on the thing I would never have guessed he did it. Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that Sam was just plain snockered. It shows in spades. The laughing bit at the early part of the film is the ONLY thing in this entire mess worth a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it I would have jumped up screaming. And now I truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than made up as they went along. It&#39;s not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards. Yikes!!!!!&#34;,
 &#34;Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut-job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I&#39;m leaning more toward the certifiably insane. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade:F &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANTI-eye candy: seeing John completely naked repeatedly&#34;,
 &#39;If this movie should be renamed, it should be &#34;The Jackasses of Hazzard.&#34; To sum it up, this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 Dodge Charger around town and in the country, chasing the girls and eluding the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a fan of the &#34;Dukes&#34; and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key. The overindulgence of profanity, sexual references, and drug use, has made the good name of the &#34;Dukes&#34; into trailer trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side from comparing it to the television show, the acting was horrible. The only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee. The others have exaggerated the character\&#39;s role which tarnished the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;Dukes&#34; have been another casualty of the 21-st century Hollywood television-to-big screen transition tragedy. Skip this movie and just buy the television series on DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grade: F&#39;,
 &#39;Taking a break from his escapist run in the early \&#39;80s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker\&#39;s &#34;The Color Purple&#34;, about about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Celie, it\&#39;s incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like &#34;Sister Act&#34;. This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no, make that SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women\&#39;s Studies. There\&#39;s one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that\&#39;s ever been on screen (you\&#39;ll know it when you see it). I can\&#39;t believe that this didn\&#39;t win a single Oscar; it may be Spielberg\&#39;s second best movie behind &#34;Schindler\&#39;s List&#34; (maybe even tied with it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia, and Laurence Fishburne.&#39;,
 &#39;This film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be forewarned that &#34;Art Heist&#34; doesn\&#39;t add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no clue what to do with the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Baldwin keeps reappearing in films, and frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks, complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies. The only good movie in which he has appeared, is &#34;The Squid and the Whale&#34;, in which he only speaks two, or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, doesn\&#39;t fare much better; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A movie to be seen at the viewer\&#39;s own risk.&#39;,
 &#39;Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn\&#39;t start shouting &#34; None Shall Pass&#34; and &#34; It\&#39;s only a flesh wound, I\&#39;ve had worse&#34;. It was one of the funniest scenes I\&#39;ve seen in the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;gladiator/demon&#34; was a stitch too. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. Kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#34;**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father (an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next) from a moth-eaten, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazis out to--what else?--build a Fourth Reich. Misty&#39;s costume, like those of some other wimmen, gets skimpier as the movie rolls on. The last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action; this footage actually gets real boring, real fast, which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it. MISTY gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast, then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this wonder-work had been cranked out four decades ago, it would have played for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video. Grab yours, quick, before it goes out of print.&#34;,
 &#34;to movie,this movie felt like one of those after school specials,only lower budget and lower everything else.i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort,but it didn&#39;t work for me.yet some how it comes across as preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance,but so what?there just isn&#39;t any excitement in this movie.the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death.of course,the whole movie feels like a bad 80&#39;s cliché.the acting was less than stellar,though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given(or in this case-not)to work with.on top of that is the poor song choices,with really bad lyrics.i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved.they are all talented,but you can&#39;t tell from this movie.this is just my opinion of course,but i have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe a 1/10&#34;,
 &#34;I want to state first that I am a Christian (and that I do work in the film and TV industry) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard. I&#39;m all for positive, uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things don&#39;t always work out ... even for followers of Christ). I&#39;m glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face. A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes, exposition aplenty, and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least. I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across. I&#39;m sure the Kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well. Maybe they could direct someone else&#39;s screenplay as their next project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc) can inspire in a multitude of ways. If you would be interested in a PG-rated film that inspires, give Steven Soderbergh&#39;s &#39;King of the Hill&#39; a look. All truth is God&#39;s truth ...&#34;,
 &#39;I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina)... I just couldn\&#39;t watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed. I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. I just don\&#39;t get how you can love that kind of movies! The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and I just don\&#39;t think it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. And that\&#39;s not a good enough reason, I think. There\&#39;s absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say &#34;Well, at least \&#39;x\&#39; thing about it was good&#34;. But well, I guess I will never understand that kind of films.&#39;,
 &#34;This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is esthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. There is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. A photography which looks very costly (and probably was not) completes the look . I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits/loners coming together and becoming a family . Sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not. This group of actors really portrays well flawed, yet extremely likable characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him , the van and the road movie theme, I could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year Little Miss Sunshine\x85) . I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio , very interesting actor, and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by Til Schweiger performance at times . The opening scene, all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I like the end a lot. And of course it is all about the Magician theme . A good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to, to create an illusion. Which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that&#39;s why they call it movie magic.&#34;,
 &#39;This impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man, in a mortal world. Her &#34;community&#34; is open among it\&#39;s members, but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals. Hmmmm...this is starting to sound familiar. LOL. It\&#39;s not your typical movie. Very &#34;campy&#34; performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting dull. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on screen, but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark, this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences...... IT\&#39;S STILL A HOOT !&#39;,
 &#39;Martin Weisz, who directed the solid &#34;Rohtenburg&#34;, will be taking the heat, with Wes Craven, for another shabby &#34;The Hills Have Eyes 2&#34;. The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only). A bunch of National Guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off. That\&#39;s it. There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little else to get excited about. The film\&#39;s &#34;heroes&#34; are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants, a far cry from Craven\&#39;s original &#34;family&#34;, mostly resemble Brian Thompson from &#34;Cobra&#34; coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the &#34;Wrong Turn&#34; shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves, ala &#34;The Descent&#34;, and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven\&#39;s addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper\&#39;s original &#34;Chainsaw&#34;. Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle, but he\&#39;s not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.&#39;,
 &#34;one of the funnest mario&#39;s i&#39;ve ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls, and good graphics for its time. there&#39;s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still, need to get more accomplished to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; though it works fairly well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if your a big time mario fan; this ones for you. even if your not a huge fan of him, i&#39;d still recommend this one. its a big game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it&#39;s very satisfying. good for playing in short bursts of time. it will almost certainly hold your interest; it sure does hold mine!&#34;,
 &#34;Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman&#39;s conviction, based on barely any hard evidence. I love films that question the media, and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system. I&#39;ve always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties. It&#39;s not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.&#34;,
 &#39;I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the Exorcist was subtle and creepy, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy, and way too formulaic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the most visually beautiful films I\&#39;ve seen in a while, but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official web site increased that interest. The web site had many tales of &#34;actual&#34; stigmata throughout history. However, scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed by its quest for &#34;genuineness&#34; that it becomes comical at first, then outright hard to watch toward the end. I began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would-be heroine cuts hair and, evidently, flirts with priests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot: A woman without faith in God begins receiving the wounds of Christ (the Stigmata) and is baffled and upset about the ordeal. A priest is sent straight from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie possessed by Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.&#39;,
 &#34;This was really a very bad movie. I am a huge fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two &#39;Demons&#39; films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad. It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the *** wife drove me mad, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film. I turned it off about three quarters of the way through because I was very, very BORED! Don&#39;t bother.&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s so little here of the fantastic Anne Rice book that what IS here makes no sense. Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don&#39;t make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there&#39;s no reason for their existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where&#39;s the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where&#39;s the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story&#39;s never explained? Where&#39;s the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with Marcel&#39;s beating at the hands of his father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she&#39;s a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performances, there&#39;s not a one that&#39;s better than mediocre, though that&#39;s likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the actor playing Richard--but Richard&#39;s not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she&#39;s given to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it&#39;d be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a slut she&#39;ll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen?&#34;,
 &#39;This is probably the fastest-paced and most action-packed of the German Edgar Wallace &#34;krimi&#34; series, a cross between the Dr. Mabuse films of yore and 60\&#39;s pop thrillers like Batman and the Man from UNCLE. It reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk\&#39;s habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip. Set at a posh girls\&#39; school filled with lecherous middle-aged professors, and with the cops fondling their hot-to-trot secretaries at every opportunity, it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politically-incorrect times. There\&#39;s a definite link to a later Wallace-based film, the excellent giallo &#34;Whatever Happened to Solange?&#34;, which also concerns female students being corrupted by (and corrupting?) their elders. Quite appropriate to the monk theme, the master-mind villain uses booby-trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows, and also maintains a reptile-replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alfred Vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors, and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show. The Monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe, tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip, while appearing against purplish-night backgrounds. There\&#39;s also a voyeur-friendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes. The trademark &#34;kicker&#34; of hiding the &#34;Ende&#34; card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here. And there\&#39;s a fine brassy and twangy score for retro-music fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant Eddie Arent character in these later films. Instead, the chief inspector Sir John takes on the role of buffoon, convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things. The krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point, and now worked on a much more blatant pop-culture level, which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers.&#39;,
 &#34;First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you&#39;re trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he&#39;s going to ruin it for you. If you don&#39;t take him too seriously, then he&#39;s actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I&#39;m just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Zabriskie Point&#34; (1970): This was especially interesting to me on a personal level, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life \x96 the Counter Culture movement of the late 60\&#39;s/early 70\&#39;s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, who are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus, and, the other, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father &amp; employer, and take on an &#34;establishment&#34; job. The film is FULL of our Italian director\&#39;s (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notations of America, and, the confused, psychedelicrazies of that era\&#39;s self-righteous, &#34;we know it all, we\&#39;ll change everything for the better&#34; youth. Just who IS the &#34;revolutionary&#34;? What does that REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and march around chanting? Do you &#34;fly in under the radar&#34; but give advance notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans to yourself, and go about the business of change, with no need for group approval? &#34;Zabriskie Point&#34; is definitely a &#34;period piece&#34; - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal film moments (after all, this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing &#34;Blow Up&#34; of 1966), and the era\&#39;s artifacts, but it is more. It presents options for cultural revolution, and going by Antonioni (who DOES seem to be supportive of it), the youth are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, any time, any place.&#39;,
 &#39;Watching this I mainly noticed the ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It\&#39;s one product placement after another. It\&#39;s quite obvious how this movie got its funding. Jessica Simpson\&#39;s &#34;acting&#34; is laughable. Any Dick shouldn\&#39;t ever get work because he plays the same lame character. The &#34;story&#34; is just a backdrop for this very long commercial. I can\&#39;t believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie the more you\&#39;re embarrassed for everyone involved. The only minor saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who gets almost no screen time as Jessica\&#39;s cousin. I\&#39;m embarrassed I watched the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this one.&#39;,
 &#39;Life\&#39;s going not to badly for Harry Mitchell, he\&#39;s an ex-air force major (plus nifty little pension I imagine), who\&#39;s raking in the cash for a patent he\&#39;s developed (fusing titanium and steel via explosive process, creating super metal fit for NASA), and his wife of twenty-odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick. He\&#39;s got a nice little pad in LA. I like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream, and you get a good slice here, what with the restored silver Jag (a series 1 E-type roadster) for him, and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her (as well as I\&#39;m sure other trinkets and boys toys). There\&#39;s always got to be more though hasn\&#39;t there? So Harry let\&#39;s himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans (you\&#39;re only as old as the woman you\&#39;re feeling). As in many films noir, one mistake, in an otherwise blotch-less life, leads to a downwards arc for Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three blackmailers leech onto him. These are where the value are for me, great character actors playing very believable roles. Bobby Shy (played by Clarence Williams III) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers. He\&#39;s reminiscent of Pluto, the vicious black ex-con psychopath from Carl Franklin\&#39;s well-regarded neo-noir &#34;One False Move&#34; (1992). There\&#39;s a similar character motivation I believe. Both men have had enough of the man, and well pretty much everyone, in extremis. Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks, a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour, and $50 for a whole hour (did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount?). He\&#39;s in over his head, and it\&#39;s great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat, believable breakdown. John Glover wins as Alan Raimy, who is the brains of the plot, an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui. He\&#39;s a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie, including what I believe is a pretty well-implied rape (pay attention to his RAP sheet readout, it\&#39;s easily missed, and read between the lines for the motel scene with &#34;Slim&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In common with One False Move, though not exclusively, I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good but I think there\&#39;s a real problem with the film. Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his &#34;tit in the wringer&#34;. My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider. Roy Scheider protagonists never lose, they\&#39;re self-sure and smooth, but not in an annoying way. I feel I\&#39;m being asked to believe that his character is in peril, the movie relies on this for dramatic tension; however I didn\&#39;t believe it. For me it\&#39;s like being asked to believe that Sandra Bullock\&#39;s character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama, or Stephen Seagal\&#39;s character is going to get taken down by the baddies (did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value). Roy Scheider doesn\&#39;t convince as an adulterer either, you don\&#39;t feel any annoyance with him at all, his character is Teflon-coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also felt like a movie that took some cuts. At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped: Harry\&#39;s wife, Ann Margaret, is pretty much a cardboard cutout, an extension of Harry, her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention. The effect that the affair has on Harry\&#39;s marriage isn\&#39;t properly communicated. This could be a Frankenheimer problem, he\&#39;s not known for character development. I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film, but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better (no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider). The film felt short, even with the long running time, and I think could have taken some more fleshing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you really can\&#39;t forget the sleaze, like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour.&#39;,
 &#34;A girl is showering unknowing that a serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone is hot on his trail, but not hot enough as they find him after he kills, rapes, and eats a nipple of the girl.He&#39;s the shot to death. One would hope that this would be the end of the film. Not because it&#39;s too horrifying, but because the level of acting is atrociously horrid. Sadly it&#39;s not the end and months later the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a coven of satanists. So he continues where he left off, with the detectives on the case again, this time a flying baby is after him too (don&#39;t ask). There has been VERY good VERY low-budget movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring to mind), but this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel. Horrible acting, crappy dime store special effects, lame attempt at comedy and oh yeah, and the ending sucks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: F &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets fully nude; Anne R. Key gets topless&#34;,
 &#39;Maria Bello doesn\&#39;t seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in. Maybe she needs those movies, to get off the sugar coated (aka &#34;Hollywood&#34;) ones she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (I won\&#39;t spoil that), Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in. It\&#39;s her performance that elevates this movie. This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, like bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long&#39;,
 &#34;This Movie has great fight scenes. Now its true that the acting is a little rough. But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty. But If you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with Amazing stunts WITHOUT the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix. Then Watch this. Now it&#39;s true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p**s his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit threw and admire.&#34;,
 &#39;I too was quite astonished to see how few people had voted on this film, and just HAD to write something about it, although my comments are quite similar to those written already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like many things about the film. The superb acting between Mastroianni &amp; Loren. The way the film is narrated: Humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders, and contrasted to the simultaneously &amp; continuously ongoing inhumane marching pace of the fascist radio announcer (who happens to be a colleague of Mastroianni\&#39;s part)and the adherents &#34;going to and coming from the show&#34;. To me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human. Maybe some of you would argue that the anti-fascist &#34;message&#34; is too clearly delivered, but to me this didn\&#39;t destroy the film in any way. My vote is 10/10.&#39;,
 &#34;Awful. This thriller should have buried. What a piece of crap. Terrible writing, characters are less than believable. Horrible Schlock!! Stick some B- stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit, but it fails miserably. If I didn&#39;t have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review, it starts with &#39;sh&#39; and ends with &#39;it&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible ending, retarded. Who writes this crap. The ending of this film is so contrived, weak it&#39;s as if they had no idea what to do with this story line, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie. It&#39;s a good thing that these actors are on the way out, because this would be a career killer. Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it. At least no one important, like future investors. It could have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated out of my precious time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t bother with this one, you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie could only originate in the 1970&#39;s!! It&#39;s a bizarre action movie set in a small California workers town. Some sort of mill or plant is closing down, so suddenly, rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets! The townsfolk&#39;s are fed up! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent), goes to another town to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam Vet who looks and acts a little\x85off balance. He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam vet&#39;s. They come into town to clean it up (they become deputized), but underneath their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc.!!! It takes a while for people to catch on, and in a biblical Cain and Abel showdown, Vincent has to take on his older brother. There&#39;s an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie, which makes it interesting (note the cock-fighting scene!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role \x96 he thinks so highly of his brother, he cannot conceive of him committing the evil deeds he&#39;s accused of. He finally comes to his senses \x96 his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back &amp; he himself is beaten up in his home. Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron. He coolly denies any wrong-doing, and even gently coos and talks to Vincent&#39;s young daughter (she refers to him as &#39;Uncle Aaron&#39;) even while he&#39;s threatening her father&#39;s life, all the while smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a &#39;saloon&#39; girl who attracts Aaron&#39;s attention. This is a good 70&#39;s action movie, if you can find it!! It is NOT available on DVD yet\x85&#34;,
 &#39;If there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong in making Dodes\&#39;ka-den, it was making it with the partnership he formed with the &#34;four knights&#34; (the other three being Kobayaski, Ichikawa, and Konishita). They wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership, and instead Kurosawa, arguably the head cheese of the group, delivered an abstract, humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies. Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows, but it was because of this, among some other financial and creative woes, that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971. And yet, at the end of the day, as an artist Kurosawa didn\&#39;t stop delivering what he\&#39;s infamous for with his dramas: the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity. That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn\&#39;t be ignored, but it\&#39;s not at all a fault of Kurosawa\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material in Dodes\&#39;ka-den is absorbing, but not in ways that one usually finds from the director, and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot. There\&#39;s things that happen to these people, and Kurosawa\&#39;s challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole. The character who starts off in the picture, oddly enough (though thankfully as there\&#39;s not much room for him to grow), is Rokkuchan, a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds (the \&#39;clickety-clack\&#39; of the title), only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother. But then we branch off: there\&#39;s the father and son, the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house; an older man has the look of death to him, and we learn later on he\&#39;s lost a lot more than he\&#39;ll tell most people, including a woman who has a past with him; a shy, quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father (or uncle, I\&#39;m not sure), who rapes her; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also little markers of people around these characters, like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night, like clockwork, putting big demands on their spouses, sometimes (unintentionally) swapping them! And there\&#39;s the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman. And of course there\&#39;s a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum, not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it\&#39;s about something erotic with a guy. First to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture; it\&#39;s a little post-apocalyptic, looking not of any particular time or place (that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets). It\&#39;s a marginalized society, but the concerns of these people are, however in tragic scope, meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force. Like Bergman, Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people, with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow, sorrowful eyes, sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes there\&#39;s charm, and even some laughs, to be had with these people. I even enjoyed, maybe ironically, the little moments with Rokkuchan (specifically with Kurosawa\&#39;s cameo as a painter in the street), or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics. But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise, his camera movements still remain as they\&#39;ve always been- patient but alert, with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots, painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper. Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories, with some of them (i.e. the father and son in the car) especially sad, Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in Eastmancolor like it\&#39;s one of his paintings. Lush, sprawling, spilling at times over the seams but always with some control, this place is not necessarily &#34;lighter&#34;; it\&#39;s like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene, where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath. It\&#39;s a brilliant, tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a sweet \&#39;movie\&#39; score Toru Takemitsu (also responsible for Ran), and some excellent performances from the actors, and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career, Dodes\&#39;ka-den is in its own way a minor work from the director, but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms, which as with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality.&#39;,
 &#39;I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael\&#39;s true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn\&#39;t. Michael isn\&#39;t a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, if you just didn\&#39;t have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today\&#39;s Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter\&#39;s Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn\&#39;t quite the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the &#34;clown&#34; mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child\&#39;s mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn\&#39;t amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: ***** out of *****&#39;,
 &#34;This is one of the most putrid movies of the 90&#39;s. I would not recommend it if you have something better to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This picture presents African-Americans as savage, uncultured, violent, inarticulate, reefer-smoking sociopaths. Fudge(Ice Cube) and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm, not just the white people, but Asians too, and are never disciplined for their actions. Despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. In fact it is Fudge&#39;s influence that causes Remmy to bond with the skin heads, to drop out of college, and eventually to kill Malik&#39;s girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police. They do commit serious crime such as battery and rape, yet they&#39;re not as repulsive nor as threatening as Fudge and Dreads(Busta Rhymes) are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle. Some of it is as follows below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fudge and Dreads are stated as students at the Columbus University yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition. One is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances. Though they are students at what looks like a private university, they cannot utter a single line of proper English. Their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that drunken Kristen(Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunken Billy was taking her to his house. She even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy. Later Kristen was assured by Taryn(Jennifer Connely) that she holds no accountability in that matter, and despite willfully jumping into a guy&#39;s bed she wasn&#39;t ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator. Then a week or so later she met, and slept with, an ultra-sensitive do-gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom. The director stressed contraception thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail. Cole Hauser&#39;s acting, and Laurence Fishburne&#39;s accent are the only reasons I can think of to watch it. The writer/director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want, but keep in mind that neurons don&#39;t grow back. Just follow the advice at the end and UNLEARN.&#34;,
 &#34;Spanish films are into a, if not Golden, definitely a Silver Age. Piédras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death-level, they still aren&#39;t really melodramatic. This could happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different stories here, which become connected. One is about the retarded girl, who doesn&#39;t dare to pass the street to the next block. One is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist. Another is about the girl with drug problems who&#39;s lover leaves her. Still another one is about the madame of a brothel who (almost) finds true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth seeing. It&#39;s in Spain the moviemakers take women seriously.&#34;,
 &#34;A fantastic Arabian adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus) search for Ahmad&#39;s love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There&#39;s hardly a down moment here. It&#39;s always inventing new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring (there&#39;s no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter&#39;s hand with a mechanical flying horse. This probably would count as one of the great children&#39;s films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time, Willis O&#39;Brien&#39;s stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn&#39;t even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.&#34;,
 &#34;If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast, and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to TV after dinner. With the constant changing of relationships and finding out who Hyde&#39;s real dad is, this show was a hit when it started in August of 98, though it was set in 1976. And hanging out in Foremans basement was always the thing to do back then, and it still is today, along with circles.This show gave great laughs in premieres, and it still does during re-runs. If you watch a few episodes of this show, you will get everything and want to get more. Now only is this show one of the best ever created, it is clever and funny.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie is weak ,The box-cover says East LA&#39;s toughest gang and it is really Santa Ana&#39;s , James Cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough Chlo gang . It is fake , boring , senseless and whack , I tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad . It was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video-box proclaims . James Cahill should act in Gay Porno .James is in every scene , he cannot act to save his life . The film features Eva Longoria who is hot but James can&#39;t even score with her !!!!!!!!! I felt at times I was watching Gay Porn and was turned - off by the whole film . James clearly want&#39;s to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again . His martial Arts skills are minimal at best , Some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one .&#34;,
 &#34;I picked this one up on a whim from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. Lots of tight, expressionistic camera work, an equally tight script, and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather the true aficionado of cinema. If Hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it, I&#39;m sure it will ruin it. A choice treat all the way around. Other posters here have more than amply sung its praises, so I needn&#39;t bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice, and mine, and don&#39;t miss this gem. Call it what you like; I call it two hours of entertainment well-spent. Read my lips: don&#39;t miss it.&#34;,
 &#39;Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight singing star. Esther\&#39;s star rises while John\&#39;s goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-converible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, &#34;Evergreen.&#34; Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can\&#39;t take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star. The very first time she appears, singing in a back alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night, not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. She is too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page out of &#34;Apartment Living,&#34; not some hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kris Kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like...well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn\&#39;t have much acting talent. The direction is tepid, the story is slow and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, or the lame direction, or the slow story. It\&#39;s the hair! After staring at Kristofferson\&#39;s and Streisand\&#39;s awful 70\&#39;s hairdos for 2+ hours, your eyes hurt.&#39;,
 &#39;So, what\&#39;s the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved therein? Why would the best show I\&#39;ve seen in years be canceled? I\&#39;m addicted. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately loved it, and watched it every week. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn\&#39;t being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC\&#39;s website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife loves Grey\&#39;s Anatomy for its &#34;realism&#34;, and I do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, does. But for once, there\&#39;s a drama that\&#39;s REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really out there, and I relate to each and every one of them. I can\&#39;t seem to get enough. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If somebody will just let it.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;9/11,&#34; hosted by Robert DeNiro, presents footage from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York, on September 11, 2001.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never too grisly and gory, yet powerful and moving. &#34;9/11&#34; is a real treat. Anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;Another FINE effort by America\&#39;s most UNDERrated filmmaker. His knowledge on the subject of racism is STAGGERING, and IMPRESSES me on more than one level. Accusations that Lee is really just a devious little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood\&#39;s Affirmative Action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter NONSENSE, mere Right-Wing propaganda. The very notion that Lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in America in order to produce hate-filled anti-white movies is simply FALSE and malicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of Lee\&#39;s detractors even go so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African-Americans, while putting down other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD disseminated by people who are AGAINST peaceful co-existence between different races in America and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black Republican and the others in the bus. The views presented by that man are simply WRONG - all across the board. 100% UNTRUE. He LACKS education, unlike the brilliantly INFORMED guys who quite DESERVEDLY throw him off the bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERRIFIC performances, and an INTELLIGENT script make for a viewing experience that has been RARELY rivaled by any political movies made since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to point out the incessant LIES that the Million-Man March had only 80,000 people taking part in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what message does Lee send here? If someone doesn\&#39;t agree with your political views, you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus. I thought the movie said &#34;get ON the bus&#34;...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Mr.Lee is for bus-segregation after all, i.e. is no different than those KKK lunatics before him: the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the Democratic Party\&#39;s line of thinking. So much for &#34;freeing the slaves&#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end-credits: &#34;This movie was entirely financed by black people.&#34; And distributed and marketed by a major Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites whom Farrakhan despises...&#39;,
 &#39;When I saw the Dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes. That\&#39;s why it has it\&#39;s R18 rating. It\&#39;s about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman. It\&#39;s best to go to your dentist &#34;before&#34; you watch this. But if you don\&#39;t like going to the dentist already, then it\&#39;s best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I\&#39;ve ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pull out all his cheating wife\&#39;s teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? Overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.&#39;,
 &#39;Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, Columbo smokes out killer, Columbo becomes a pest in the process), the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme, and the result is a major flop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Would you believe: Columbo never faces the villain till the very end?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oh, the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make!!!&#39;,
 &#39;I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a Public Service Announcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised an inauthentic low-budget mini-epic, but this one refused to let me switch channels. It was staggeringly, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn\&#39;t tear your eyes away from. I reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity. You\&#39;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Just to get it over with, Beowulf\&#39;s warriors wore horned helmets. Trivial issue compared to what came after. It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next. Fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become king of the Danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn\&#39;t had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- To facilitate the actors\&#39; return to their day jobs waiting tables, none were required to change their hairstyles at all. The variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog. To prove it was a multi-national cast, all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As is typical with this type of movie (at least since Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. In this case it was odd-shaped, ill-fitting and brand-new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long-standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The unintended focus of the movie was a repeating, compound crossbow with exploding bolts. It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired. It managed to shred the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, historical fact and plot suspense all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hrothgar\&#39;s palace, Heorot, rather than being a Norse long hall, apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Beowulf arrived at the Danes\&#39; homeland in a two-masted stern-castled ship that originally was part of a set, the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Prince Unferth observed Beowulf\&#39;s ship\&#39;s approach using a telescope. Before you could recover from that astounding innovation, you got to see the ship from his point of view. Judging from the angle, the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fun fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (as from a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the actors\&#39; breath whether indoors or out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fun fact 2: Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fun fact 3: You, too, can make a catapult with a timed-release air-burst explosive. But, don\&#39;t expect it to actually harm anything. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II, yelling &#34;Incoming!&#34; to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he couldn\&#39;t leave footprints. Even in snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Grendel\&#39;s mom (&#34;Hag&#34;) was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn\&#39;t inherited her wings. Recessive gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now make an educated guess that Grendel\&#39;s pop was probably Swamp Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Grendel and mom chose to randomly kill, fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fun medical fact: Being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that don\&#39;t bleed much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The sword of legend Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Best line of the movie: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet. Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said, &#34;You\&#39;re going to be okay, my prince.&#34; So much for that job at the triage clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better now.&#39;,
 &#34;Back in the day, I remembered seeing dumb Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me! I was not estatic, but curious... I was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck. My friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy (i&#39;m actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!! First off, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so dumb and I hate how so many fanboys drool over Tiff, it&#39;s sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the King Dedede (who sucks big time in this show) and I hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying Dedede with those awful weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then began to hate Kirby even more since it was obvious Nintendo was just aching to get Kirby some popularity. Kirby&#39;ll never beat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness. NUF SAID!!!&#34;,
 &#39;One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism, the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin. Classic movies like &#34;Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari.&#34; (1920) and &#34;Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens&#34; (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement, and while the movement didn\&#39;t have a long life, its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today, specially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener, director of 1920\&#39;s &#34;Der Golem, Wie Er in die Welt Kam&#34;, as in his debut as a filmmaker, seven years before the making of that classic, he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally, another horror film: &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; (&#34;The Student of Prague&#34;), is the story of Balduin (Paul Wegener), a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague, but who always find himself with financial troubles. One day, Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit (Grete Berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again, but soon he discovers that he\&#39;ll have to compete with her rich cousin, Graf Von Schwarzenberg (Lothar Körner), who also wants to marry her. Knowing that he can\&#39;t offer her much, Balduin wishes to be wealthy, and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli (John Gottowt) enters the scene. Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room. Balduin accepts the proposal, only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe\&#39;s short story &#34;William Wilson&#34; and the classic legend of &#34;Faust&#34;, the story of &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers, a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature. Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form, &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. Like most of the scriptwriters of his time, Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater, although &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; begins to move away from that style. While a bit poor on its character development (specially on the supporting characters), Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; was Paul Wegener\&#39;s directorial debut and Stellan Rye\&#39;s second film as a filmmaker, it\&#39;s very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly. Giving great use to Guido Seeber\&#39;s cinematography, the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do. Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his &#34;Golem&#34; series from Seeber and Rye. Despite having very limited resources, Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing (for its time) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin\&#39;s reflection (played by Wegener too). Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film, Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Balduin, Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer, but one can\&#39;t deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. Few is said about Scapinelli in the film, but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. The rest of the main cast is less lucky, with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit, and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg. However, it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg, showing the dignity that Lörner\&#39;s character should have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake (made 13 years after this film) is superior in every possible way, it\&#39;s not difficult to understand why &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; hasn\&#39;t stood the test of time as well as other early films. The movie\&#39;s main problem is definitely its extremely low budget, as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers\&#39; story needed to be fully developed. This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times, or even incomplete, as if there was something missing in the narrative (of course, there\&#39;s also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete). However, &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that, while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time, left a powerful impression in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement, it\&#39;s hard to deny the enormous importance that &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; has in the history of German cinema, probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time, but considering the limited resources its director had, it\&#39;s truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegener\&#39;s career, and with that German expressionism, &#34;Der Student Von Prag&#34; is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 7/10&#39;,
 &#34;This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so. It did not happen here, I am afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit his father&#39;s skills, unfortunately (neither did his sister, who can however make movies which one might watch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s see: the lead male actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says, the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element, the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks... Would that be enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regretted every single moment I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie. It&#39;s as if a François Truffaut plot were directed by Dick Cheney...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You must be really joking...&#34;,
 &#39;I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday, intending to tune-in to something else. Out of curiosity, I accessed the comments here, and found myself watching it to the end. I really didn\&#39;t do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where you\&#39;re &#34;fascinated,&#34; and watch it for &#34;another couple of minutes,&#34; until you finally just watch to the end. And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano, and their earlier roles. But great isn\&#39;t anywhere to be found anywhere here - story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb. mark), and Ben Matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them. No real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. Actually Perry nearly always did this, but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, pronounce it &#34;reasonable doubt,&#34; and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that said, Holland Taylor\&#39;s histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her, in the courtroom portion of this story, made the actions of Matlock/Mason more-closely resemble the slow, often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in real-life courtrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every character in this presentation was either insipid, unsympathetic, obnoxious, boring, improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if &#34;3rd-&#34;) roles, even in this venue. Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story/performances, and 3 additional for the fascination factor.&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;The Hills Eyes II&#39;, one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time, is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest. Or worst, however you choose to look at it. While 2006&#39;s &#39;Hills&#39; remake was one of the year&#39;s best, and truly frightening, horror films, this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment. Part 2 never gets off the ground, and neither does its mind numbing dialogue. Worst of all, it&#39;s not that scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2006&#39;s remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the New Mexico desert, deserted, and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people. People who, as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago, have become who they are. Surviving off travelers who wander into the region. The sequel puts audiences in the same desert, now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family. When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite, they find it deserted with no signs of life. A grim reality soon befalls them, as they come to the realization that they&#39;re not alone. And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t take a genius to realize that &#39;Hills&#39; has no legitimate reason to exist. But because last year&#39;s remake was received well both at the box office and by critics, it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there&#39;s still money to be earned. There&#39;s no rhyme or reason to it this time around, just an unbelievable and ridiculous set-up to pave the way for thoughtless characters, unoriginal killings, a non-existent story, and slipping interest. Originally, director Alexander Aja made Craven&#39;s cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience. One that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions. Its frank display of violence, sadistic torture, well-rounded characterization, and white-knuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences. The second time around, it&#39;s rehashed hand-me-downs. There&#39;s no style, no grit. It tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies, when all it really does is make for a been there, done that kind film, where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention. It&#39;s a bore, nothing more. &#39;Hills&#39; has no bite. Despite a jump or two here and there, there&#39;s nothing very scary about this by-the-numbers horror flick. It feels like something you&#39;d see on the Sci-Fi channel, only with some F-bombs, a blood splatter here and there, a rape, and a graphic birth scene that&#39;s more gross than shocking. It&#39;s cheap. And with &#39;Hills&#39;, you reap what you sew. With no effort given, you can&#39;t expect anything in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing Aja with Martin Weisz as director was the film&#39;s first big mistake, all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance. But even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by Wes Craven and his son, Jonathan Craven. You ask, how bad could it possibly be? This is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like Shakespeare. Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past, but I&#39;d never expect something like this from him. It&#39;s so unintentionally funny, you have to wonder, is Craven playing a joke on this? Or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off? The film&#39;s characters are one-dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense. The acting is just as bad. The only character who may win you over is &#39;Napoleon&#39; Napoli, the scrawny kid who doesn&#39;t fit in with the others. Even the deranged and instinct-driven villains, who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago, are met with indifferent. You don&#39;t hate them, you don&#39;t like them. You honestly couldn&#39;t care less. Just like this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you were giddy with fear during &#39;The Hills Have Eyes&#39;, as I was, you&#39;ll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage. It&#39;s as generic as generic gets, and there&#39;s absolutely nothing here we haven&#39;t seen done many times already. I can&#39;t express this enough, avoid &#39;The Hills Have Eyes II&#39; like the plague. It&#39;s frightless, unoriginal, frantic, and a bore. Stick to the remake or Craven&#39;s original vision. Because if you don&#39;t walk out after the first thirty minutes, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&#34;,
 &#39;First, this was a BRAVE film. I\&#39;ve seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons. However, I cannot begin to understand the people who\&#39;ve trashed this film. I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I\&#39;d be lying if I didn\&#39;t say I wished that every guy who\&#39;s ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what Jared got. Conversely, it didn\&#39;t solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn\&#39;t pretend to is what made me appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with. I certainly did and intently. I\&#39;m 24 years old. The way the film drags made it realistic to me. People have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film, not only do they lose interest, they demolish whatever has been built, and call it rubbish. When in actuality it\&#39;s their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosario Dawson displayed the numbness of self-destruction flawlessly. I think she portrayed Maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely ever see done well. Often times, much like the films &#34;aimed at teens&#34; mentioned in the prior comment, the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to: drone-like existence in the waking hours, working some dead end job to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this film told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape. So many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning...I believe that Maya\&#39;s face during the act was the end...not the act itself...not the vengeance or the meaning behind it...just her face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you&#39;,
 &#34;Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Contrived plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, Ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison. C&#39;mon. Rent Another Day in Paradise instead.&#34;,
 &#34;One of, if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who &#39;seduces&#39; two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In turns gratuitous, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It&#39;s no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar&#39;s only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level.&#34;,
 &#39;MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H. Lewis, arguably one of the very finest directors of Hollywood noir films. This 65 minute Gothic oddity from Columbia Pictures came after Lewis\&#39; lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns, East Side Kids comedies, horror melodramas (including the incredibly bizarre Bela Lugosi shocker THE INVISIBLE GHOST) and standard studio B product (SECRETS OF A CO-ED, BOMBS OVER BURMA, THE FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO, etc)---all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive Mr. Lewis. MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS (as well as SO DARK THE NIGHT from the following year) introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets. Later Lewis productions like GUN CRAZY (1949) and THE BIG COMBO (1955), despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure, continued to rely upon deft, lucid camera work and effective low-key lighting. And very modest resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS probably owes more to the tradition of British mysteries (it\&#39;s set in a studio-bound England) than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings. A young woman (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and, mysteriously enough, with a brand new identity---that of the old woman\&#39;s daughter-in-law. Told that she\&#39;s been the victim of a nervous breakdown, she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament. But before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery, that her &#34;husband&#34; (the always menacing George Macready) most probably murdered his real wife and that she\&#39;s been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme. Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that Lewis brings to the production, marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director.&#39;,
 &#34;Heavenly Days commits a serious comedy faux pas: it&#39;s desperate to teach us a civics lesson, and it won&#39;t stop until we&#39;ve passed the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), have a spat with their Senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace!! A year later, he was considered a near communist dupe, but in 1944, he was A-OK. Add in some truly awful musical moments, a whole lot of flagwaving hooey, and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters, and you&#39;ve got a film that must have had Philip Wylie ready to pen Generation of Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically unfun, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the Devil has all the best tunes.&#34;,
 &#39;The Ramones, whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan (P.J. Soles) who faces off against a merciless, joyless principal (Mary Woronov) for the right to rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and execution. It\&#39;s chock full of riotous sight gags (like the mouse experiment), teenage spirit (probably my all-time favorite film opening), and bizarre, off-the-wall moments (the straitjacket scenes). If you\&#39;re looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level, look no further. But if you\&#39;re looking for a nice, dignified, dramatic epic, maybe you should look a wee bit further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hi everybody, I\&#39;m Riff Randell, and this is Rock &amp; Roll High School!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish Horror Movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is all in films like El segundo nombre, a TV-like production bad written, but acted and directed even worse. I didn&#39;t read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I&#39;m sure that the author of The Doll Who Ate Its Mother didn&#39;t have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you&#39;re searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater. 2/10&#34;,
 &#39;I am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made. If you can\&#39;t make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose differently. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of these are racist) and very unfunny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as I write this, I cannot believe this was actually a movie scene). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is &#34;I knew I should have been on top.&#34; ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........&#39;,
 &#39;Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that\&#39;s all this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point: casually walking into a room and saying &#34;Hello&#34; was scored with chase music from a roman epic. I\&#39;d like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: that women\&#39;s low-rise panties existed in 1954. I\&#39;m talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). Also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a &#34;Look out! Godzirra!&#34; effect.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m starting to write this review during a break as I watch the movie. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve tried doing that, but I&#39;m having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks. That&#39;s not because it&#39;s intense but because it&#39;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s almost painfully tedious and unbelievable, especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on screen being tragic and bitchy, self-indulgent and self-pitying. This would have been a much better movie if they&#39;d just left that character out of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe somebody decided that if they couldn&#39;t make Ryan believable they&#39;d just make him obnoxious. The problem with that is: Who cares if a spoiled, whining, obnoxious jerk is dying? Not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing this character has going for him is the fact that he&#39;s dying, and sorry, but that&#39;s just not enough. Dying doesn&#39;t make anybody special. We&#39;re ALL dying, sooner or later. It doesn&#39;t give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two characters, and the actors playing them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are very much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan&#39;s self-pitying interruptions, would have made a much better movie. But it&#39;s not over yet, and it&#39;s time to hit PLAY again. Maybe something great happens before the end....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Sorry. This rented turkey goes back tonight!&#34;,
 &#39;A very weak movie, mainly because of a poor story, but also poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and irrational behaviour by many of the characters. If you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it\&#39;s creativity or acting criteria, then you may like this movie. Personally I can\&#39;t do that with a drama and found this too far-fetched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m particularly annoyed when a main character, that is supposed to be an intelligent person, continually acts like a complete imbecile. In this movie, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first highly unlikely act is when the main character, a successful attorney named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, is leaving a party and happens upon a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who is screaming that her car has been stolen. They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town, they notice that her car is in the driveway. Also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things are very odd, she\&#39;s weird (looking like a tramp, she undresses in front of him until she\&#39;s completely naked \x85 oh yeah!). Also, the father\&#39;s strange, the house is a wreck -- everything should have told Magruder, &#34;hey this is too weird for me, I\&#39;m out of here!\&#39; But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by her story and sex, takes up the case of trying to have her father committed. It all screams set-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, being the top-flight attorney that he is, he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before, (a fact that all of the women in the office notice). Is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16-year-old? Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming, with ample evidence, that the father is terrorising them, the police ignore him. I could have believed begrudging assistance. But no help at all -- not likely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s just too unlikely.&#39;,
 &#39;I bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. It invariably supersedes anything else on those &#34;Cosmo\&#39;s moon&#34; nights. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay. What? You don\&#39;t know what a &#34;Cosmo\&#39;s moon&#34; is?&#39;,
 &#34;I can remember this movie from when i was a small child, i loved it then and I still do now. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th Birthday and was over joyed because I had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger. My favourite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is filled with fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think that if i hadn&#39;t seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as I do although I still believe that I would still like it because I am Really into animated movies.&#34;,
 &#34;The second in the Vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tasteless, below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here. That fault surely lies with director Hackerling, who&#39;s obviously nowhere near as good a director as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it&#39;s simply not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments aren&#39;t played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (like how the English are SOOO polite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from a few scenes, there&#39;s hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick. But if you&#39;re a Chevy Chase fan (like myself) the film is watchable, but no more than that.&#34;,
 &#34;It takes guts to make a movie on Gandhi in India ,in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances are terrific ,the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous,but the film drags.If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations,which i assume is the case here,then its a brilliant attempt,but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success,then the film&#39;s fate was doomed the day they chose this subject..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 yrs from now,this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one..And honestly,his is not the only performance worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is terrific too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father&#39;s death.No dialogues,No screaming,but a speechless shot by Khanna.Its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gandhi,My Father is not at all exciting cinema but yes,its excellent cinema and a must watch.Brilliant Attempt..&#34;,
 &#34;Who doesn&#39;t have unresolved issues with parents? And which parents don&#39;t have unresolved issues with each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, that sounds heavy. But this is played for laughs in the movie, making both the comedy better and the drama better. I&#39;ve always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted from the very first scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person. And Peter Falk&#39;s monologue about being a hard-working, sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point. Without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done, Paul and Peter!&#34;,
 &#34;... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater (I don&#39;t rate movies that I see only on TV). This is the ONLY movie I have ever rated ZERO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I took our four children (then aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who alerted me to this site (amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time (and is even worse in retrospect), the acting (particularly by Sean Young) is atrocious and the story line is simply silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;Somebody could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of famously bad movies (e.g. &#34;Manos: The Hands of Fate&#34;) that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary, witless waste of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, why not a documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, that would begin to answer some of the real questions like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good line: During an &#34;orientation&#34; session for guests: &#34;People, I can\&#39;t emphasize this enough: NO WEAPONS!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. It is far superior in action than most movies since. Martin Sheen is excellent, and though Nick Nolte has a small part, he too provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sheen &#34;tests the water&#34; in his \&#39;34 Ford (COOL) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is grand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m disappointed in the low vote this received. I figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good taste eludes the masses!&#39;,
 &#34;Every time I see Nicole I like her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just won&#39;t give up on, but she keeps breaking your heart. First movie I remember seeing like this was Of Human Bondage, the Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The beefs about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can&#39;t speak Russian, I&#39;m sure. Funny how people miss the point. The no-goodnik Russian guys were well cast too. Finally, I have to tip my hat to Ben Chaplin, as somebody else noted, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole. To think, guys get PAID for that, mind-blowing.&#34;,
 &#39;.... And after seeing this pile of crap you won\&#39;t be surprised that it wasn\&#39;t published &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!! SPOILERS !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible movie by any standards but when I point out that it\&#39;s one of the worst movies that has the name Stephen King in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . The movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34; My god . What happened here ? &#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34; I don\&#39;t know but they sure hate cats &#34; *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . Boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . Oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you\&#39;re going to be watching a bad movie &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it\&#39;s very illogical and confused . We eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . Would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an American coastal town ? Having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - That\&#39;s the only thing we learn . We never learn how they\&#39;re able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR . Monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? The demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . If they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . I guess that\&#39;s so the production team can come up with an ending . It was that they started the movie my complaint lies &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We\&#39;re treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like John Landis , Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos . I think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they weren\&#39;t going to appear in a movie this bad so Stephen King had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . That\&#39;s how bad SLEEPWALKERS is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Unbelievable as it seems that wasn\&#39;t the worst line in the movie . The worst line is - &#34; That cat saved my life &#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had &#34;jumped the shark&#34;, so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with &#34;The Brady Bunch&#34; they introduced the annoying \&#39;Cousin Oliver\&#39; and with &#34;Family Ties&#34; they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! With the Moto films, they\&#39;d jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you kept hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! Although he\&#39;s supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon &#34;act&#34;. It\&#39;s so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here. With WWII approaching, the films couldn\&#39;t have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply wouldn\&#39;t have been accepted in the US or in allied countries.&#39;,
 &#34;William Hurt may not be an American matinee idol anymore, but he still has pretty good taste in B-movie projects. Here, he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean-ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run --played by former pretty-boy Weller-- who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. Current pretty-boy Hardy Kruger Jr --possibly more handsome than his dad-- is featured as Weller&#39;s arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving. Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable &amp; high-cheekboned love interest for hero Hurt. Michael Brandon pops up to play a slimy take-no-prisoners type whose comeuppance you can&#39;t wait for. The Coca-Cola company wins the Product Placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production, shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture-postcard Hungary.&#34;,
 &#34;Having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons, I believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the themes are crusty and stale to today&#39;s viewers, it is by no means a crumby waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse, the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted by another reviewer, it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy, sit back and loaf idly through the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this short-bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it.&#34;,
 &#39;First off, I\&#39;m a huge fan of 80s movies, and of Jennifer Conelly as well. So yesterday, I wandered into a local used book/movie store and found a VHS copy. I read the back and it sounded good and for $3.99, it was a good deal. So I took it home and popped it in the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age now, I relate more to movies like About Last Night or St. Elmo\&#39;s Fire, but still I remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. We all have those little crushes when we\&#39;re younger. And if it doesn\&#39;t work out, we\&#39;re heartbroken and we think that we\&#39;ll never get over it. But of course we do. Many times. It\&#39;s that sort of sweet quality that I really got from this movie. The feeling of &#34;Oooh! I remember when something like that happened to me...&#34; is all through it. The characters are interesting and well-developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies, teen films in particular, or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.&#39;,
 &#39;Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about such and interesting true story. It had such promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something out of a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what was suppose to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn\&#39;t. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the &#34;King&#34; dying. I liked the Queens\&#39; punishment. And, the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I don\&#39;t recommend this.&#39;,
 &#34;This is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors - Corey and Danny are soo annoying. Corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to Danny&#39;s false promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neve Campbell and the killer from Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film. Danny (Dean Paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he&#39;s trying to bed - Corey looks as if she&#39;s still in college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in Australia, this film is called Too Smooth; there is nothing smooth about this film at all. 1/10 Avoid&#34;,
 &#39;Jackie Chan\&#39;s Police Story is a landmark film for both the Honk Kong action genre and the career of Jackie Chan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed/written by Chan, Police Story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre, and like most of the the films of Police Storys\&#39; kind, the script is nothing to be raved about. But the plot of the film is Jackie Chan, who plays a nice guy cop, struggling to convict the local gang lord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that Jackie Chan has given us, that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece &#34;Miracles&#34;. However the job that Jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable. The standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances in this film also vary with Jackie giving a very solid typical Chan nice guy up against it role, but this is by no means his best acting role, that can been seen in the Sammo Hung directed film &#34;Heart of the Dragon&#34;. The other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as Jackie with Bridgete Lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well, but neither does she display full acting potential. The standout acting comes from Maggie Cheung as Jackies\&#39; suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief. None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised, modern setting, the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera. To begin with there is a shootout in the slum where Koo (ganglord) is making a drug deal, whilst being no John Woo style sequence, this serves as a nice starter for the film. This is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight. This is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by Bad Boys 2. In the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as Jackie tries to transport Bridgete Lin from her house to his. This is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films. This sequence is fantastically choreographed, timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene. However, as tradition dictates, the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film. This sequence displays some of Chans\&#39; best choreography, stunts and camera/editing work. This sequence is now famous for two things, the amount of people sent through high density glass, which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people, and the stunt at the end where Jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony, grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof (this has to be seen to be believed). Whilst the two for-mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant, i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is Chans\&#39; ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography, that for me has never been bettered. I also believe that the action in Police Story is some of the best filmed and edited action of Chans career helping to set the action apart from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Police Story, despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding, is one of the best action films of all time displaying Chans best choreography, best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone. Afterall, we watch a Chan movie for the action!!&#39;,
 &#34;I am so confused. What in the world was this movie about? What was the killer&#39;s motivation? He seemed quite angry, but I have yet to figure out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I guess would make it a hill. Or a pile. Of crap. The acting was horrible. When I searched for a few of the actors in this movie, they had been in very few things that I had heard of, and that came as absolutely no surprise. I can&#39;t decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad, or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. Starting . . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really, though, don&#39;t waste your time with this. There&#39;s so little substance that there&#39;s nothing there even just to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- NO, one of the worst flicks of ANY KIND, that I have ever had the misfortune to watch, and I&#39;ve seen quite a few.&#34;,
 &#34;The season finale sent mix messages, I felt feelings of joy, and also feelings of being lied to and deceived. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband, Dan, had died. She also admits the family never won the lottery, and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be. I&#39;m still confused about when she said Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit to being pregnant. So I believe that is just how she wanted it to be, but it wasn&#39;t. So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)&#34;,
 &#34;This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I&#39;ve seen a lot of bad movies. First of I&#39;m from Kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all. Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest. On top of that it looks like someone was like I&#39;ve only got $20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don&#39;t worry about researching btk at all just make up something. seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie. The slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter BTK did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie. The made for TV ones are way better and way more accurate&#34;,
 &#34;I was on France, around March 05, and I love to go to this Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d&#39;Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I&#39;ve never went to it. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is stunning. It doesn&#39;t caused the impact on me like with the Mexican users, because it was french-subtitled but it&#39;s still shocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico. It is a crude portrait of the city. Of a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kinda connection with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? Man on Fire, that was stunningly strong, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico. Or it is like The Brave One. A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard. This is like The Usual Suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. Verdict: A film that shocks and makes you believe that there&#39;s no security on the streets anymore. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and astonishing performances. Cero y van 4 is a film that you won&#39;t forget soon. Leaves you shaking and stunned.&#34;,
 &#34;This was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in New York City and centering around a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he&#39;&#39;s a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s kind of fun to watch until a profane tough New York City-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over. That ruined the film for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairdo on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: it odd to hear a film made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen&#39;s) with just mono sound.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m a fan of C&amp;C, going back to their records, and liked this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980\&#39;s on cable television in San Jose California, it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie. All references to marijuana were replaced with &#34;diamonds&#34;. The bag that &#34;Red&#34; drops to Chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same (&#34;...it\&#39;s worth ~$3000/lb&#34;). There is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing C&amp;C, and talking to each other about getting the diamonds. At the end, instead of &#34;space coke&#34;, it\&#39;s something else. I\&#39;m not sure who created this version, but it was horrible, and obvious that they were attempting to make it family/child friendly. It would have been better if that network had not aired it at all.&#39;,
 &#34;The final season of Roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy. This final episode does just what a previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not. Roseanne reaches back to season one, and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life. She says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she made him live. As events happened in her life, she changed them in her writing. Don&#39;t we all wish we could do that. Don&#39;t we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an eraser and change to our liking. This is what she did with the entire episode. And to another comment I would say that I don&#39;t feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, she just changed the way that events happened in their lives. An A+ ending to an A+ show!!!!&#34;,
 &#39;With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It\&#39;s a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - \&#39;Silence While Men Are Working\&#39;. The early story at the boys\&#39; apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like &#34;We must have been dis-unconnected&#34;, but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship - &#34;Self preservation is the last law of averages&#34; - precisely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m not as great a student of Laurel and Hardy\&#39;s films as many on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, &#34;Saps At Sea&#34; provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it\&#39;s way to hornomania.&#39;,
 &#39;This movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. There are some interesting visuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it\&#39;s typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. True to the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not worth picking apart the story. That\&#39;s like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There\&#39;s not much there to begin with. It\&#39;s nothing original and not very special. So don\&#39;t go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great FX treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. However if you ignore the &#34;standard&#34; pyrotechnics, it\&#39;s a sight to behold (or not to behold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it\&#39;s a decent FX film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone.&#39;,
 &#34;Busy is so amazing! I just loved every word she has ever done- freaks and geeks, Dawson&#39;s creek, white chicks, the smokers. after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day. i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in Israel. if someone hasn&#39;t saw is excellent movie than don&#39;t waist more time and go see it now. i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies. i saw busy in the late night show with Conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her! everybody who saw the movie- in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful! you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine (maxim) she looks so good there! ~DANIELLE~&#34;,
 &#34;Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever. And as for the feminist polemic, it&#39;s laughable. I saw this garbage when it was first released and though I found it tedious beyond belief I&#39;m glad I did go to see it. That&#39;s because I now have an immediate answer to the question &#39;what&#39;s the worst film you&#39;ve ever seen?&#39; Plus, I have the comfort of knowing that every film I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson. But I have to admit I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world (as is revealed in the closing credits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film. All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes, a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady, and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public. So why shouldn&#39;t she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness that is The Tango Lesson?&#34;,
 &#39;Movie &#34;comedies&#34; nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin-kicking. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they\&#39;re becoming rarer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Mr. Blandings Buildings his Dream House&#34; shows what 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it\&#39;s just screamingly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house\&#39;s riotous construction, all the way to the finished home--with its &#34;zuzz-zuzz water softener&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as he watches the house\&#39;s costs zoom out of control). However, the film is stolen by the Blandings\&#39; wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Managing to steal every scene he\&#39;s in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the Blandings\&#39; harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh. I think it\&#39;s a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you\&#39;re building a house or not.&#39;,
 &#39;Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks (at least folks who might do such a thing) sit around and talk about film noir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet some of the best films of the genre, &#34;Out of the Past,&#34; &#34;The Killers,&#34; &#34;In A Lonely Place,&#34; &#34;Night and the City,&#34; manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows, fedoras, and femme-fatales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Where the Sidewalk Ends,&#34; a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective Marc Dixon\&#39;s crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, he\&#39;s that familiar &#34;cop with a dark past&#34;, but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems. And yeah, he\&#39;s been smacking around suspects for too long, and the newly promoted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically robust and commanding outing) is warning him &#34;for the last time.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. And boy didn\&#39;t they had have it coming? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hoods, dusters, mugs, gutter nickel-rats&#34; he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about Dixon\&#39;s right hook. The advice is for him to cool off for his own good. But instead he takes matters into his own hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away he\&#39;s in deep with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner. Dixon\&#39;s questionable involvement in a murder &#34;investigation&#34; threatens his job, makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in. Like Bogart in &#34;Lonely Place,&#34; can he &#34;escape what he is?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the marvelous Gene Tierney) who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor\&#39;s existence into something worth coming home to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping. The group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all of this top-notch direction and acting isn\&#39;t too slick or buffed to loosen the film\&#39;s emotional hold. Gene Tierney\&#39;s angelic, soft-focus beauty is used to great effect. She shows herself to be an actress of considerable range, and her gentle, kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in &#34;Leave Her to Heaven.&#34; The scenes between Tierney and Andrews\&#39;s Dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self-destruction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near the end of his rope, cut, bruised, and exhausted Dixon summarizes his lot: &#34;Innocent people can get into terrible jams, too,..&#34; he says. &#34;One false move and you\&#39;re in over your head.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to factors you have no control over. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. &#34;Where the Sidewalk Ends&#34; does so in a realistic fashion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(One nit-pick of an aside: This otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn\&#39;t seem out of place on Mystery Science Theater. How very odd.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Noir fans -- heck, ANY movie fans -- who haven\&#39;t seen this one are in for a terrific treat.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m not saying that because the production values were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. That shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? It was terrible, the lighting was just plain bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course not I skipped through most of it, and I don\&#39;t want to hear anyone say I need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. This film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it\&#39;s just plain terrible. Awful movie...don\&#39;t waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it\&#39;s not because of the actors &#34;funny&#34; lines, it\&#39;s because of how painstakingly bad the production is.&#39;,
 &#34;Everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories \x96 a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on Christmas Eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains. So that he can avoid his partner&#39;s fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of Christmases past, present and yet to come, so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late. A rather morbid tale one might think, but it is classic Charles Dickens, and also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me this is the definitive version of Dickens&#39; timeless story; it&#39;s the one I always remember watching in school, and I remember being absolutely terrified by it! The ghost of Jacob Marley, the final scene with the ghost of Christmas present under the bridge, and the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come especially I found very frightening. How on earth did the film gain the &#39;U&#39; certificate? (For non-UK readers &#39;U&#39; is the lowest classification, it means family friendly and children welcome, nothing to scare them etc... This is certainly not the case though, as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper-like spectre of Christmas future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be that as it may, from the many versions of this classic story I have seen adapted for film, this is possibly the most faithful to the book. Most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of Christmas present showing Scrooge the two children hidden under his robe (you&#39;d never get away with a scene like that nowadays!). The two children represent Ignorance and Need (although changed to Want in this film).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes, the main one of which being that George C. Scott&#39;s portrayal of Scrooge seems simply not cold enough. He laughs too much. I don&#39;t want to use the word jolly because of course Ebeneezer is anything but, but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man, rather than the positively unkind, cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films. Patrick Stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed, and Michael Caine, despite acting alongside the Muppets, was positively cold. Further, the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent. He appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit&#39;s final lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ignoring this one (albeit major) quibble, it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart-warming Christmas tale, as all Christmas films should be. London of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow-covered English town that many Americans probably imagine it still is (the truth is that even then that London was grey and grimy \x96 and any snow would never have been so white!) And everyone is so impeccably dressed too, even the poor people look rather dapper. But of course it&#39;s a Christmas film, so why shouldn&#39;t everything look nice? Perfect holiday season viewing; coupled with copies of It&#39;s a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street and The Snowman and you&#39;ve got everything you need.&#34;,
 &#34;Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone&#39;s story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it&#39;s laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO&#39;s A Bright Shining Lie.&#34;,
 &#39;WARNING!!! TONS OF DEAD GIVEAWAYS!!! DON\&#39;T READ IF YOU HAVEN\&#39;T SEEN THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, WHATEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They\&#39;re are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can\&#39;t be uttered. But When Elm Street 6: Freddy\&#39;s Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) just stops for his final breath, This film was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz, Then you see a kid who is named only as John Doe, Who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and gets out of Freddy territory. A woman who resides at a hospital/ place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy, and at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower, and a promise of a secret floating in her mind, goes back to Springwood to figure out this frightening vision, and soon finds out that she is Freddy\&#39;s child, And we soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him. And beyond that, fright ensues. This film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film has tons of humor, and cameo appearences, like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and Iron Butterfly\&#39;s &#34;In-a-gadda-da-vida&#34;, then gets stuck in a super Mario parody of sorts. This film will either make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more. The best of the best.&#39;,
 &#39;This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his Nick Charles character (from the &#34;Thin Man&#34; series). While the story is good on its own, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz\&#39; fantastically imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured movie, with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split screen images, to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie.&#39;,
 &#39;Holy crap this is so hysterical! Why aren\&#39;t American comedies written like this? For anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb-- there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. I couldn\&#39;t believe it was the same guy as House! There are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series, &#34;the oppressed mass&#34; Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: &#34;When someone messes with a Wellington he really puts his foot in it&#34; and Baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin Macadder &#34;the top kipper salesman&#34; and homicidal swordsman from Scotland.&#39;,
 &#34;STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray&#39;s son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It&#39;s a tale of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together, despite not being strong enough. If you pick up a little of what it&#39;s about from the off-set, you can see it doesn&#39;t promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn&#39;t disappoint in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s true what everyone said about the performances, and the lead stars, Winstone and Burke, do deliver some great acting. We see Winstone lose it with his wife, beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia, breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. Likewise, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase, the full impact of the night before kicking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another of those films where there&#39;s no &#39;plot&#39; to follow, as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. It&#39;s been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize it for this, knowing what I knew about it from the off-set, but sadly this is how I found it. **&#34;,
 &#39;The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is awful and 2) the love interest of Kelly\&#39;s character leaves much to be desired, (IMHO). Do love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter\&#39;s. I\&#39;m 28 and she\&#39;s 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is as always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I have ever seen him in, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. It is no wonder Paula Abdul &#34;sampled&#34; Kelly\&#39;s moves. I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you were to watch only one part, don\&#39;t miss Kelly\&#39;s dance with Jerry Mouse. You will NOT be disappointed.&#39;,
 &#34;As a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it&#39;s almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Outside of &#39;Calamity Jane&#39;, I&#39;ve never seen her put over a song better than she does here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn&#39;t see much screen time. It&#39;s been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance. With so many familiar faces, it&#39;s hard to keep track. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;Even when I saw this movie at a teenager, I wondered just how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Ms. Zadora is, even she couldn\&#39;t keep this sorry-ass excuse of a movie from tanking. Not even her photoshoot for Penthouse, in which &#34;The Lonely Lady&#34; was promoted &#34;back in the day,&#34; could keep this movie from tanking. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this one a miss.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Mechenosets&#34; is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I\&#39;ve ever seen. The name of the film can be translated in English as &#34;the sword-bearer&#34;. The main hero (Sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand. At first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. But it is not about Mechenosets. He hardly can be even called the anti-hero. I think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him. And suddenly he meets her. She doesn\&#39;t need the idle talks and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She doesn\&#39;t care what he did. The fact that he\&#39;s next to her is more important than anything else. But soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before her very eyes. Even after that she couldn\&#39;t escape her feelings. They try to run but it\&#39;s hart to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. He is caged; she is in a mental hospital. They don\&#39;t know anything about each other, but she believes that he\&#39;ll save her. He surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her. They run again but they aren\&#39;t invulnerable. She is wounded, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them. He doesn\&#39;t know what to do, they drive into a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopter around them, but there is no need for it, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in the whole world again.&#39;,
 &#39;I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the most I\&#39;d laughed at one of Woody\&#39;s comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I\&#39;ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her &#34;sexy&#34; image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than &#34;Devil Wears Prada&#34; and more interesting than &#34;Superman&#34; a great comedy to go see with friends.&#39;,
 &#39;I remembered this show from when i was a kid. i couldn\&#39;t remember too much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. for some reason i remembered it being really intense. also it was on really really early in the morning up in PA. I finally, after looking around the web for a long time, found an episode. the first episode no-less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. it was obviously just made to show kids playing lazer tag and having a great time. the show opens with bhodi li telling his mommy &#34;my names not Christopher, I\&#39;m bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR!!!!!&#34; we then are forced to watch kids playing lazer tag to the song &#34;foot loose&#34;. and not just a quick little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yeah, and as if i couldn\&#39;t get worse, you cant even see the laser beams from their guns. its like they\&#39;re just running around to the entire &#34;foot loose&#34; song. later on, after bhodi goes up into space or where-ever, they have a crappy laser gun fight to the Phil Collins song &#34;su-su-sudio.&#34; ah, trust me, you don\&#39;t want to know the rest. what can i say......THE LIGHT SHINES!!!!!!!!!!!&#39;,
 &#34;i know you&#39;ve read that before, on countless other films no doubt if you&#39;re reading the comments here, but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i&#39;ve been able to track down. no doubt the really bad ones aren&#39;t even available to buy or watch on tv, but even so i feel it&#39;s fair to qualify that i&#39;m not just some dumb renter who picked badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#39;ve seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb, and i&#39;m ticking of the remaining ones with every chance. most of those stand head and shoulders above this... excersize in absolute monotony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like to rate truly bad films (as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are) by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through. if you can watch it by yourself, it isn&#39;t that bad. if you can watch it with one single friend... it&#39;s bad but could be a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy. and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films (spotting the boom mic for example, 3 times in this one if i&#39;m not mistaken) could take away the dry taste in my mouth. yes i&#39;d watched it, but i&#39;d also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope and pray we saw the directors cut... to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me. so much of the film centers around this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget, just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it isn&#39;t a good film. the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money (considering inflation) and was an utter gem. it&#39;s not an excuse for how bad this baby is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spoilers ahead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#39;s not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters... the pacing of the film... is insane... nothing... is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging. no matter what your alignment or sex... rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the acting is cheese... but not overly amatuer... i&#39;ve seen a lot worse in better films... but somehow it&#39;s the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you&#39;ll ever hear in a film, that really grates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rent this if, like me, you have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you&#39;re going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it. this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair. it&#39;s an endurance test you probably want to skip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#39;m sure there is worse... but i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it has decoteau&#39;s name on it.&#34;,
 &#39;I saw that when I was little and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices where cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. Whats Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. Whats sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that bops the Meecy Mices on the head then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent the kids will like this show, new words, songs, and watching them playing.&#39;,
 &#39;Jeffrey Combs is an insane scientist whose stem cell research has morphed into a diabolical scheme to create a hybrid hammerhead shark humanoid life form, hoping to breed a brand new species using Hunter Tylo\&#39;s womb. It won\&#39;t be easy for Tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend, William Forsythe, isn\&#39;t about to give her up without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see Tylo and Forsythe are two of business executive Arthur Roberts\&#39; employees, brilliant minds who meet Combs(..a scientist who once worked for Roberts, and whose vacated position went to Tylo)at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments. This island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and &#34;son&#34;. They think it\&#39;s a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases. Combs\&#39; son was dying of kidney cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him, creating this blood-thirsty, flesh-eating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land(..although, at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods). Tylo was dating Combs\&#39; son, hence the connection besides the two having worked for Roberts, who brings along his trophy wife, Mariya Ignatova. Also accompanying Tylo and Forsythe, Roberts and Ignatova, are their colleagues, Elise Muller and GR Johnson. Combs traps them in a conference room, but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like similar sci-fi channel creature features of it\&#39;s type, Hammerhead:Shark Frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks(..where the shark rips apart limbs)are shot in a quick-edit, frenzied camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage. You have this vague notion that a person is being eaten(..ripped to shreds), but the attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which, truth be told, is rather infuriating. The monster itself is never seen in it\&#39;s entirety, just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror. One thing\&#39;s for certain, you do see teeth. We do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen, all menacing, ready to feast on flesh. A constant is while(..and after)victims are attacked, we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the water\&#39;s surface(..this is really director Michael Oblowitz\&#39;s main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs doesn\&#39;t break new ground as the scientist, but he\&#39;s always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold-blooded resolve. It\&#39;s fun seeing Forsythe in a rare clean-cut hero role, very against type as an electronics wiz(..to his credit, he actually pulls it off)who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril. Tylo is also in a very different kind of role, a scientist who can defend herself quite well. Roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep, and it\&#39;s kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at Combs\&#39; soldiers(..although, his fate is not pleasant). Mentioning that, it was also really entertaining watching Forythe and Tylo downing Combs\&#39; hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns. As expected, the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins..I mean, seriously, would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do? Beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop.&#39;,
 &#39;A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late Oscar-winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benjamin Martin is Matthau\&#39;s agent and nephew, and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau\&#39;s grumpy character--he\&#39;s just the same as he always is, and yet also very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns, as the absent-minded old man, is just as funny as Matthau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau: Want some crackers? I\&#39;ve got coconut, pineapple and graham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns: How about a plain cracker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau: I don\&#39;t got plain. I got coconut, pineapple and graham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns: Okay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau: They\&#39;re in the cupboard in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns: Maybe later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or how about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau: When I did black, the whites knew what I was saying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You\&#39;ve got to see it in the movie to understand it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a refreshingly hilarious, sweet, heartfelt, warm, belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just don\&#39;t make them like this anymore! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude, juvenile and stupid, this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters, smart and funny dialogue, and grand entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best buddy comedies of all time, right up there with &#34;Planes, Trains and Automobiles,&#34; &#34;Lethal Weapon,&#34; and &#34;The Hard Way.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- John Ulmer&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;La Lupa Mannara&#34; aka. &#34;Werewolf Woman&#34; of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title, but, sadly, the film itself is pretty far away from being a must-see for my fellow Italian Horror buffs. You won\&#39;t hear me say that Rino Di Silvestri\&#39;s film is entirely bad - it has its stylish moments, and the first half is actually great fun to watch (though the fun is unintentional). The film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress, Annik Borel. However, the film, which has no real plot (at least no linear one) often makes no sense at all, and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniella (Annik Borel) has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a Werewolf Woman. Since she was a raped as a girl, Daniella is afraid of men. Then, when her sister (cult siren Dagmar Lassander) comes to visit with her husband, Daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a Werewolf Woman herself... or something. The storyline really doesn\&#39;t make the slightest sense, which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half. The leading character Daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac, who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman. Director Di Silvestri chose to make up for the plot-holes with a lot of of female nudity, which works fine for me. There are also some pretty well-done gore moments. The film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy, but it is very entertaining in the beginning. Also, there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze, the camera often does close-ups on the Miss Borel\&#39;s private parts for the simple heck of it. I\&#39;m not complaining. Then, for some reason, Di Silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going. While Daniella is, at first, a typical werewolf, who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse, this suddenly changes when she meets a guy (Howard Ross, who was in Fernando Di Leo\&#39;s &#34;Il Boss&#34; of 1973). Suddenly, she goes back to normal again, and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half. It gets pretty damn boring after a while; all things considered, it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long. At the end, they even want to make us believe that the absurd story (if one can call it that) is based on true events. &#34;Werewolf Woman&#34; has some redeeming qualities; my fellow Italo-Horror fans can give it a try. However, if you wanna watch Italian Horror/Exploitation cinema from the 70s, there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one.&#39;,
 &#34;Wonderfully put together..I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. It was great..the film wasn&#39;t long enough..I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they don&#39;t; actually its the hetero&#39;s that we need to look into..this film didn&#39;t even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for that..I really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. Thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.&#34;,
 &#34;This film is just another distortion, among many distortions, on the so-called &#39;sins of consumerism&#39;. Please note that &#39;Reverend Billy&#39;, an actor (Bill Talen), is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the &#39;sins of consumerism&#39;. We might want to ask are questions, like: What does &#39;Reverend Billy&#39; do for a living? How does he make his money? Does he make his living off his &#39;tax-deductible&#39; organization? How does the Internal Revenue justify this as a &#39;tax-deductible&#39; church or organization? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that Christmas is commercialized, but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable, and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families, friends, or extended families. Everyone is not charitable. Everyone does not spend time with their families, friends, or extended families. But, holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity. Yes, America does have more than its share of problems--but, with perseverance, Americans have and always make it through great difficulties. And, even in times of strife, America has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world. That happens when Americans pull together and unite, rather than to separate and divide. Yes, there are problems with corporations and monopolies, but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses, along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities. Yes, globalization has brought us its share of problems, but it will take Americans to bring production back to America. Americans and the U.S. government need to learn how to stay on a budget, no matter how large or small it may be, and we must stop our dependence on credit. Our over-reliance on credit will make, and keep us poor, from the cradle to the grave. It is important to buy--but, if we buy less, we will rely less on credit. And, if we are able to save, even a small amount of money, we will have money for a rainy day. Not to say that, as Americans, we will gain an equal share of wealth. Wealth is not guaranteed, and has never been guaranteed. But, stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans hold most of America&#39;s wealth. There is a good proximity that you or I can reach the level of the upper, middle class. And, who knows what can happen from there?!? Be positive, work hard--and, at the very least, you and I will be able to reach at least some (if not all) of our dreams. In life, nothing is guaranteed, but we always have that something to reach for. And, if you or I don&#39;t have dreams, we might as well be dead. In America, there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams. As individuals, we are a part of the pack, but we always can become the leader of the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions, but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs, values, and perspectives. But, as far as the distortions expressed, within this film, I do not have any faith in such beliefs, values, and perspectives. I rank this film with a 1 out of 10--but, in all honesty and truth, this film deserves a zero. This film has no integrity, and I cannot recommend it.&#34;,
 &#34;Govind Nihalani&#39;s directorial venture of Vijay Tendulkar&#39;s novel is brilliant. Om Puri plays an inspector Velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty, played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar. This is Govind Nihlan&#39;s Most talked about movie. This is a very good and a classic film. Smita Patil plays the female lead opposite Om Puri. Naseeruddin Shah is brilliant in a cameo role. Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie. This was Sadashiv Amrapurkars acting debut.Om Puri won a national award for this film for the best actor. Filmfare award winner for Best Film,Story,Supporting Actor(Sadashiv Amrapurkar).&#34;,
 &#39;I can fondly remember Bo Derek\&#39;s heyday and the UK press attention (the mucky Sun &amp; News of the World papers especially)- all following her small role in &#34;10&#34; with Dudley Moore. Understandably, much fuss was made of her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, acting is, and never was, her forte! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain DVD bins- Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for the &#34;So Bad They Are Great&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a guilty &#34;must buy&#34; of mine! Should you ever read your press, or this comment Ms Derek, please do not be offended- ALways had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability. Much Love.x&#39;,
 &#39;If this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on &#34;facts&#34; that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of &#34;racist&#34; judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60\&#39;s and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now thats inspirational) Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest passing on this one.&#39;,
 &#34;Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story. He get hooked up with a guy living in modern times, and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times Keaton is able to do his sight gags very well. I&#39;ve heard his voice before. I believe he did some of those Beach Party films, playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. It&#39;s not a bad story. It shows how one reacts when we wish for something we don&#39;t have and get that wish.&#34;,
 &#39;I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon-wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. The accessibility is marvelous! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the first War. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t be mistaken: &#34;Caprica&#34; is not BSG. We are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casting maintains BSG\&#39;s standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply astounding. Morales\&#39; portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos\&#39; portrayal of William, gives a wonderful glimpse of William\&#39;s heroic father. Stoltz\&#39;s portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what\&#39;s yet to come, RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG\&#39;s legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.&#39;,
 &#34;This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930&#39;s about one of Spain&#39;s poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let&#39;s admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it&#39;s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn&#39;t Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?&#34;,
 &#34;I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that&#39;s the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). I don&#39;t remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. It&#39;s a movie that gives you the creep and it&#39;s worth a look. But where do i find it? How can i download it?&#34;,
 &#34;This noir may not be the best remembered film from the era, but it features a great mystery plot, the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members. Robert Siodmak, the talented director behind the mystery/horror classic &#39;The Spiral Staircase&#39; directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film, and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer. Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson; a man married to a woman he doesn&#39;t like. He picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night, and the two agree to a &#39;no strings attached&#39; night of fun. However, he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties! He&#39;s dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her, and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife. However, luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot moves along nicely throughout, and unlike many of the better known noirs, this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting. In fact, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white, I would swear Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo! The central characters are all interesting enough, with Alan Curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim, and Ella Raines being effective as the female impromptu detective. The real standout of the film, however, is Franchot Tone, who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece. The film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire Elisha Cook Jr, who features playing the drums in the film&#39;s most memorable segment. If I was to criticise this film, I would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although Phantom Lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it. The conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense (which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line) and overall, Phantom Lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen noirs ever made!&#34;,
 &#34;Tom and Butch Cat fight over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn&#39;t catch Jerry gets kicked out. The two cats dress in their master&#39;s clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it! Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master&#39;s rear and all three of them get kicked out.&#34;,
 &#34;and not in a fun-to-watch way. it&#39;s just bad. it&#39;s shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it&#39;s not scary, the special effects aren&#39;t special--oh no! the blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh gee--the mirror turned into water! the hair, clothes and makeup in the &#39;50s scenes aren&#39;t accurate, and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high-school version of himself. this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff. i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else, but there are better bad ones out there to choose from.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen. For me, that\&#39;s what makes it so awesome! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked wonderfully together &#34;comedically.&#34; I wish Yvonne De Carlo, as Lily, would have had more plot involvement. She showed that she could do comedy in the original series, but it was mostly wasted in this movie. This movie also stars the great Sid Caesar, but sadly he doesn\&#39;t have any interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think some better work could have come out of that.&#39;,
 &#34;Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls. Script, pacing, and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set, but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields&#39; character as well as graphic deaths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny, an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid, and a children&#39;s movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a buddy picture, a coming of age picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelogue, and a western. The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon. That it manages to do just fine.&#34;,
 &#34;One of Cary Grant&#39;s most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today. Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post World War II years. Returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the GI Bill of Rights which included home loans. The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. Around the time the book by Eric Hodgins and the film were so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender- Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early Fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester. Their place wasn&#39;t quite as grand as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna most likely did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late. Truth be told he&#39;s kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myrna Loy&#39;s role is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine the Charles&#39;s moving to the country and William Powell having the headaches Cary Grant does, the film would still work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.&#34;,
 &#39;I couldn\&#39;t agree more with Nomad 7\&#39;s and I A HVR\&#39;s comments. A perfect laid back Sunday morning movie. The humor is subtle (exact opposite of &#34;slapstick&#34; as one misguided commenter noted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what always ceases to amaze me is how often I find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over. I originally copied this movie onto VHS about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those Pay Cable free weekend previews(HBO maybe?). Had never heard of it previously. Don\&#39;t know why it wasn\&#39;t marketed that well. ?? When DVD\&#39;s were released en mass, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. Plus, the back drop of Montana wilderness doesn\&#39;t hurt things either (beautiful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is? If Adam Sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won\&#39;t be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. The humor is mostly in the dialog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. But I still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, I\&#39;m going to loose it (Ed O\&#39;Neill\&#39;s face is PRICELESS!). Recommended 110%.&#39;,
 &#34;In Hazzard County, Georgia, cousins Bo and Luke Duke (Scott, Knoxville) and their cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) run moonshine made by their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while avoiding the local authority, Boss Hog (Burt Reynolds). Their problems with the Boss are only beginning as they learn he&#39;s been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen the TV show and after watching the movie, I&#39;m not going to start any time soon. I like stupid comedies but this one didn&#39;t offer many laughs. It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through. The second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity. The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much. The characters in general weren&#39;t very interesting and the actors portraying them didn&#39;t do a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting wasn&#39;t very good. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances. The latter was pretty good as Stifler but he tries way too hard here. The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else. Jessica Simpson isn&#39;t known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing. She&#39;s famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things. She is pretty but she&#39;s a weak actor. It doesn&#39;t matter though because she doesn&#39;t really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn&#39;t complex or anything. Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he doesn&#39;t do anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screenplay was written by John O&#39;Brien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard. The first one was Cradle to the Grave, which was okay. The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny. He doesn&#39;t do a good job here though as the story is a mess. He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better. The movie is also pretty long for a comedy. Okay, 106 minutes isn&#39;t exactly long but it feels so much longer because there&#39;s very little humor in the first hour. I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time. The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes. The car sequences were average and they don&#39;t save an already troubled film. In the end, Dukes of Hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it&#39;s better if you just skip it. Rating 4/10&#34;,
 &#39;From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son &amp; Father, son\&#39;s girl friend, and two male characters of the son\&#39;s age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son\&#39;s girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was &#34;older&#34;. End of that story.&#39;,
 &#34;Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make this among Errol Flynn&#39;s greatest outings in a career of great outings. I would think this role playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as. Flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. The extra thing I wanted to point out is notice the great montages, transitions, and still inserts that punctuate the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent collaborator with Flynn, with cinematographer Sid Hickox, the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel went that far back but he&#39;s listed right in the credits. He would go on to a great career as action director himself.&#34;,
 &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie &#34;Slugs&#34; is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry. You see, these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and don\&#39;t mean to do anything malicious, they\&#39;re just slugs- slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison, but slugs none the less. The real bad guys are the humans, who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs, or overreact when they encounter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs. They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them, and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spills some highly volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks a bookcase over on himself, and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes. How can you blame that on the slugs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable. The characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody, the drunk hick who\&#39;s mean to his dog, and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There\&#39;s also a set of drunken teens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that get attacked while copulating, and we have to see the skinny long-haired freaks\&#39; genitals. Meanwhile, there\&#39;s a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells &#34;You don\&#39;t have the authority to declare happy birthday!&#34; for some reason. Finally, this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the MST3K classic &#34;Pod People&#34; whose face explodes after eating a slug-laces salad (another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful, harmless slugs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and, in one pointless scene, as would-be rapists. In the movie\&#39;s climactic scene, the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers, Well, since they\&#39;re idiots, the humans succeed in BLOWING UP THE ENTIRE TOWN. They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate humans, and I know I do, you\&#39;ll appreciate &#34;Slugs&#34;. If you\&#39;re a fan of bad cinema, you\&#39;ll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of &#34;Pieces&#34; and &#34;Pod People&#34;. There\&#39;s enough bad acting, silly dialog, illogical plot twists, lame special effects, pointless scenes, and poor dubbing to hold your attention.&#39;,
 &#34;There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that&#39;s where the moral comes in. It&#39;s when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot&#39;s of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film hit&#39;s the right note throughout, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It&#39;s pitched just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80&#39;s genre of these kind of movies, because you don&#39;t see many like this one anymore! I want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? I&#39;ve never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically its about the popular group in school, who like to make everyones lives living hell, so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named Marty. It turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, its like 10 years later, and the group of friends who hurt Marty start getting High School reunion letters. But...they are the only ones receiving them! So they return back to the old school, and one by one get knocked off by.......Yeah you probably know what happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part that disappointed me was the very end. It could have been left off, or thought out better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you should give it a try, and try not to be to critical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~*~CupidGrl~*~&#34;,
 &#34;This has the funnist jokes out of all the Cheech &amp; Chong flicks. It&#39;s the first one I saw with these guys. I found it to be really good. My dad actually recommended me to get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLE MODEL, and my GRANDMA actually bought it for me, knowing what it was like. What a family I have. Well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic. I must warn you though, this isn&#39;t gut-busting funny. It has its moments but not as funny as There&#39;s Something About Mary. Check it out anyway. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll laugh. Unless your an anti-drug activist or something.&#34;,
 &#39;This is definatley one of the best stand-up shows evre. EVER. Eddie is so off the wall that I\&#39;ve been watching this damn show for nearly five years now, and it still rocks every single time. Just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks, it\&#39;s a masterpeice. You need look no further than this line &#34;The word herb. You say erb, and we say herb, cuz ther\&#39;s a f###ing h in it&#34;. Brilliant.&#39;,
 &#39;I watched this on a whim because it was available and I\&#39;d heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one was not. The majority of the jokes were based around &#34;Geranium\&#39;s&#34; physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet\&#39;s. I think it\&#39;s really pathetic of the the &#34;Thumbtanic&#34; creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) doesn\&#39;t starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part was the line that goes something like, &#34;Hey, I have a great idea! Let\&#39;s swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!&#34; Thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value.&#39;,
 &#39;Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the fabled Atlantis. Along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. Along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. The voice cast is great. They surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent. The music is nothing special but likable anyway. The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.&#39;,
 &#39;The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the &#34;whole Earth&#34; picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, a response: &#34;Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I\&#39;d say is a charming, but weak and gullible argument. What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U.S. government that the moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. Things are nearly never quite what they seem.. Just watch the movie, and I dear say you\&#39;ll see things a bit different than before.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, weather data doesn\&#39;t come from NASA, it comes for met agencies around the world. Second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. Third, far from being &#34;packed with irrefutable evidence&#34;, the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked. Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims.&#39;,
 &#39;I rank this the best of the Zorro chapterplays.The exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play.There is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter.Reed Hadley does a fine job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last,but certainly not least,is the great directing team of Whitney and English.&#39;,
 &#34;Written and acted by sincere amateurs, produced by some exploitation monger, this is dull and hard to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the worst movie ever, but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two. I&#39;d recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore Dispensationalists. I&#39;m neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t believe me? Watch it for free (albeit sourced from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant links added mostly to reach IMDb&#39;s 10-line minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/&#34;,
 &#34;For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again. There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread. His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European breads. The show is as wacky as they come and I&#39;m sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world of Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to look like they&#39;ve just had an orgasm after eating bread. The bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers, from time-traveling to swimming like a fish. That weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows I&#39;ve watched in a while.&#34;,
 &#34;This is the best movie I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That month they were showing a Yugoslavian movie every Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next week there was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name of which I don&#39;t remember. If you know it, please let me know! In any case, how can I get to see this movie again???? A DVD of this movie, where?? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next week there was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name of which I don&#39;t remember. If you know it, please let me know! In any case, how can I get to see this movie again???? A DVD of this movie, where?? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the good ones. The cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists I didn&#39;t see coming before each commercial. To me it was kind of like Medium meets CSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I&#39;d definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dedee was great. Haven&#39;t seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re into to TV mystery movies, check this one out if you have a chance.&#34;,
 &#34;I admit I have a weakness for alternate history stories, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY to 12:01. Among those greats is this little gem. It&#39;s pretty difficult to get through MR. DESTINY without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member, from the goodhearted James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film, but it&#39;s a fine cheer-up on a rainy afternoon. It&#39;s also a great rental for an inexpensive date.&#34;,
 &#39;This is one of the worst movies i\&#39;ve ever encountered, but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pure film-making technique goes, this director is competent. He\&#39;s held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional. i\&#39;ve seen many movies where the &#34;directing&#34; was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there. Also, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go. As far as artistic merit, there is none. The scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film. This is pure trash... Total garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gore is decent for a film in this budget range. , it\&#39;s obviously fake but there\&#39;s lot\&#39;s of it, and it\&#39;s very outlandish..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the American version with the intentionally campy dubbing. This was a good idea (and it\&#39;s the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film)... Unfortunately, it\&#39;s overdone, especially towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s really a terrible film, but i have to recommend it for it\&#39;s camp value. It\&#39;s really hard to find a movie that\&#39;s worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category.&#39;,
 &#39;This is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie Lynch stuff. Rather, it\&#39;s for those who either appreciate a good story, or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish &#34;This is such a wonderful movie! You must see it!&#34;-semantics (tho\&#39; she IS right, for once!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken along a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at some time. A compassionate, existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting is without faults, cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.&#39;,
 &#34;First off, I would like to point out that while I am not an expert, the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence. Firstly, the prosecution never proved that &#39;facilitated learning&#39; actually works. Irresponsible for both the prosecution(because they can get an appeal) and the defense for not acting on this. As another commenter said, facilitated learning was proved untrue. Secondly, they used Terry as the translator who has personal interest, and even will testify, in the trial which is just stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify that way, they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal. Thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution(birthmarks, details of the event, etc.) and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started, he could not answer. If that isn&#39;t reasonable doubt I don&#39;t know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism, but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable.&#34;,
 &#39;I have always been a huge fan of &#34;Homicide: Life On The Street&#34; so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up, I couldn\&#39;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I\&#39;ve ever seen. It was great to see everyone back again, but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show.&#39;,
 &#34;I stopped five minutes in when Beowulf was given a double-shot, automatic crossbow with sights on it. Not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights, but Beowulf beat Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The terrible, wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci-Fi Original Movies didn&#39;t help either. Having only gotten a few minutes in before I felt my bile rise and decided to watch I Love Lucy reruns instead, that&#39;s really about all I have to say. But, you might as well just realize that it&#39;s a made-for-TV movie and skip it right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A travesty.&#34;,
 &#39;The movie was a big Car Commercial. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who cares? I went to the theater to view the Shelby Cobra, Angelina &amp; Cage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess it was a good movie. *bg*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;I would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand I was fully able to understand it for what it is.. A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. The director firstly presents the material in an extremely &#34;arrogant&#34; way and worse, extremely incoherently. It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to CARE by the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn\&#39;t seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s compare stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe\&#39;s &#34;Seul contre tous&#34; to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it\&#39;s fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things.... to a POINT. But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say &#34;Who cares.&#34; It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film TRIES to make the viewer look foolish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what I have said of it. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.&#39;,
 &#34;This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot. It is another sailors on leave film, zippier than Astaire&#39;s &#39;Follow the Fleet&#39; but not as good as &#39;On The Town&#39;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their &#39;If you Knew Susie&#39; number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it. &#39;I Begged Her&#39; is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing. Sinatra&#39;s solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story. Fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi as himself, to keep one watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly is the star of the film, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the Kelly character. He also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the Pomeranian (!)navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl, Sharon McManus, that is entrancing and sweet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant then but a bit too long. A taster of better musicals to come.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately the movie was rather short, unusually so for a period piece, and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect. However, the excellent story makes up for it. The four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds. Over the course of the movie, they realize their problems and begin fixing them. They believe San Salvatore, the castle they stay in, has an enchanting effect on people. &#34;It\&#39;s a tub of love,&#34; says Lottie Wilkins. You can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the Italian seaside works its magic on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All their problems and their solutions are plausible. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic Italian locale. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;d have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the \&#39;King of the Cowboys\&#39;; made in 1948, the picture came out a decade after Roy Rogers\&#39; earliest pictures in which he had a starring role. Roy\&#39;s character comes off as a bit clueless in this one, along with his female co-star Jane Frazee, who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston, portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan. The whole story seems kind of muddled, with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so. Like the legend of the \&#39;Hangman\&#39;s Hotel\&#39; for example, which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight. With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher, you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up. Instead, you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick. It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve, who truth be told, wound up getting more screen time than Trigger, who\&#39;s contract as \&#39;Smartest Horse in the Movies\&#39; didn\&#39;t have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule. And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude. I don\&#39;t know about you, but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh well! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough, and that turned out to be Roy\&#39;s athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys. OK, it was probably a stunt double, but I haven\&#39;t seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture, as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 1947/1948 time frame. In &#34;Under California Stars&#34;, she appeared as Andy Devine\&#39;s cousin, appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher. You\&#39;re never quite convinced what side she\&#39;ll come in on in this story though, since she starts out pretending to be someone she\&#39;s not, and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown. I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role, but he played it pretty straight after all. I had to wonder, when it was all over, why he and old Vanderpool (Charle Coleman) wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be. Just a way to close it out I guess, with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture. I hate to be that harsh, but if you\&#39;ve seen enough Roy Rogers flicks, you\&#39;ve got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say, Sintown - I wonder if that\&#39;s the same place that grew up to be Sin City?&#39;,
 &#39;Arguebly Al Pacino\&#39;s best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he\&#39;s got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn\&#39;t break\&#39;em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss\&#39;s sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony\&#39;s young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma\&#39;s Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant (&#34;Say goodnight to the bad guy&#34;). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it\&#39;s a must-see. For the rest of you it\&#39;s highly recommended. 10/10&#39;,
 &#39;If there was a God, he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was crapped up. This is BY FAR the worst vampire movie I have ever seen. I may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie. It makes Zombie Lake look like The Sound of Music.&#39;,
 &#34;Watching this movie made me think constantly; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn&#39;t able to stop...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#39;t many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative cliche&#39;s make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as leak as a sieve etc. That makes this movie a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;Predictable, told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between, a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia, 70\&#39;s style incidental violin horror music that is comical at times, i couldn\&#39;t help chuckling to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually like Defoe, and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad, the &#34;plot&#34; develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time. Its just that it\&#39;s all too predictable, i felt like i was watching a made for TV drama instead of a new movie. Maybe thats the style the directors wanted, but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t expect too much, and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn\&#39;t have gone to see it at the cinema. I would wait for the bargain bins at your video shop, I\&#39;m sure it wont take long.&#39;,
 &#39;What a crappy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. No-talent-what-so-ever-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record-button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along? Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what? My friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur-movie for their school-project which outdid this geeky movie.. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life! There is just no excuse for this flick!&#39;,
 &#34;Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the Law and Order ADA&#39;s and her acting is even worse here. Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed, as if she can&#39;t remember where she left her keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an important true story, so it&#39;s too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can&#39;t overcome Rohm&#39;s tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever actual acting is required.&#34;,
 &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn&#39;t going to make it with the younger crowd. Still, part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro&#39;s interpretation of Che Guevara&#39;s personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. It&#39;s clear Soderbergh doesn&#39;t look down on these people, but it&#39;s also clear he&#39;s not going to plea their case to &#39;yanquis&#39; far removed from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I&#39;ve read. To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is right on, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control. The country&#39;s treasury was left empty.&#34;,
 &#39;Some people say Steve Irwin\&#39;s larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act. Watch this film: it\&#39;s obvious he can\&#39;t act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his *Crocodile Hunter Diaries*, *Croc Files* and eponymous *Crocodile Hunter* series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?), rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with *Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course* (yup \x96 there\&#39;s a definite trend of words beginning with \&#39;C\&#39;) - basically an episode of *Crocodile Hunter* mashed together with a B-Movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and wife Terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom), out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed. Will it hurt my credibility to say &#34;They\&#39;re on a Collision Course with Wackiness&#34;? (what credibility? - Ed note.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is irrelevant, as it is Steve\&#39;s animal magnetism that propels the film. If you find his persona trying, the film is a failure, but if you\&#39;re a fan of either him (as a businessman, conservationist or just plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Stainton, faithful liege, best mate and helmer of the Crocodile Hunter *oeuvre* (can it be called that with a straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made Steve a household wildlife jester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most jarring aspect of this movie is that Steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks) and Terri (Steve\&#39;s spouse of 10 years, fiercest ally and closest friend) treat it like it IS one of their documentaries, breaking the &#34;fourth wall&#34; and speaking directly to the camera, whilst all the other characters behave as if they\&#39;re in a bad movie (well\x85). It wouldn\&#39;t be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters \x96 but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steve\&#39;s life, we Confused Viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn\&#39;t at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics, or run screaming into the bush \x96 anything but continue filming casually with great lighting, crisp audio and seven action angles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Terri is unfairly painted as Steve\&#39;s mildly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last, I\&#39;m not complaining), Steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, well, to him they\&#39;re not really stunts, just a Day At The Office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, watching this madman\&#39;s koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings. But to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *Crocodile Hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So enjoy this diversion for what it is \x96 a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend. He died doing what he loved \x96 interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)&#39;,
 &#39;A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they\&#39;ve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem &#34;solved&#34;. They are of course &#34;out foxed&#34; at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The&#34;film&#34; version ,and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So kudos to them .They\&#39;ll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book.&#39;,
 &#34;The combination of the superb black and white photography and the &#39;Eugene Onegin with a twist&#39; plot made this a real knock out for me. The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping. There was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by Lensky&#39;s heart-wrenching aria from the Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium, which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - Last Year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film. Krisana is in the same mould.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Some day, we\&#39;ll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun. Some day, when the world is much brighter&#34;- The 5 Stairsteps &#34;O-o-h Child&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies about Black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip-hop soundtrack. Films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find, yet there is an undiscovered gem that I would like to recommend. Our Song, by Jim McKay is about three girls in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction, one that may involve going their separate ways. The story is told from the point of view of a 15-year old, not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies. Avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of F-words, it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life. The girls: Lanisha (Kerry Washington), Joycelyn (Anna Simpson), and Maria (Melissa Martinez) are in their sophomore year at the local high school. They are active members of the Jackie Robinson Steppers, a real-life marching band whose rehearsals for a Labor Day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to David Gordon Green\&#39;s George Washington but less stylized, the film showcases non-professional black and Latino actors with Kerry Washington as the standout. While the performances have some amateurish moments, I became so involved with the story that I forgot the girls were even acting. Maria, whose father is in jail, has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell, a local student. She wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that Terrell is probably not going to be of much help. Joycelyn works in an up-scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer. In a very poignant scene in her bedroom, she pretends to be talking to her fans, then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems. She is close to Lanisha and Maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood. None of the girls receive much support at home and Maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby. Yet, the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics. They are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanisha\&#39;s parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father, a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music. Her mother is comforting when Lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide, a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film. As the summer winds down, the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course. There are no big dramatic moments, however, only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change. Though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them, we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative. Our Song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility.&#39;,
 &#34;wonderful movie with good story great humour (some great one-liners) and a soundtrack to die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#39;ve seen it 3 times so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the american audiences are going to love it.&#34;,
 &#39;The 700 Club gives a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy. I find the program to be informative and inspirational. It is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful. There are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated, I find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism. I have certainly said some foolish things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he puts out a great show.&#39;,
 &#39;I am a 11th grader at my high school. In my Current World Affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch. So we did. I am firm believer that we went to the moon, being that my father works for NASA. Even though I think this movie is the biggest piece of crap I have ever watched, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all did he have to show JFK getting shot? And how dare he use all those biblical quotes. The only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates, which is good b/c in my class we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should be working together and make another movie. Michael Moore next movie could be called &#34;A Funny Thing Happened on Spetember 11th&#34; or &#34;A Funny thing happened on the way to the white house&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;John Van Druten\&#39;s &#34;Bell, Book and Candle&#34; is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern-day witches living in New York City; it was obviously an attractive movie property. It had a stellar part for Gillian Holroyd, for her erstwhile book publisher enforced-sweetheart, Shepherd Henderson and her madcap family and circle, including Shep\&#39;s bewildered fiancée, the hateful Merle Kittredge, against whose chances with Shep Gillian begins her magical spell-casting. It even had Pyewacket, a Siamese cat-familiar with well-timed miaows, Sidney Redlitch, a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners. In short, it seemed to its producer, perhaps, box-office magic. And so it proved to be. So many things were right about its production, it only had one element not perfect; but I found the rest to be amusing, charming and very consistently-entertaining. To begin with, the screenplay by Daniel Taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include Greenwich Village and other areas of New York\&#39;s scene. The technical production was beautiful, with cinematography by the legendary James Wong Howe, a fine score by George Duning, more-than-clever sets by Louis Diage and gowns by Jean Louis. In the attractive cast were Wolfe Barzell, Howard McNear, Janice Rule as Merle, Ernie Kovacs as Redlitch, Jack Lemmon as Gillia\&#39;s mischievous brother, wonderful comediennes Elsa Lanchester and Hermione Gingold as fellow witches and lovely Kim Novak in one of her most touching parts as Gillian. Jimmy Stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment; he did well with the comedic portions of his part, but he was never convincing as a New York book publisher, and a bit too-old for the part of Henderson anyhow. But director Richard Quine used subtle lighting, pace changes, and unusually-composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film, keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation. The plot\&#39;s main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality Gillian falls for Henderson, who does not believe in witches at all. She started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée, her stuck-up college rival. Later, when Henderson tries to walk out, he keeps coming back to her--and realizes he is under a spell, as she has apologetically tried to explain to him. ..Meanwhile, Sidney Redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to New York to sell his book to Henderson. Of course he knows nothing at all of magic, but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all; but Gillian\&#39;s brother enlightens him. All comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as Gillian proves her love to Henderson by losing her powers--which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal. Of course, he never really wanted to resist her anyhow. The film has sprightly dialogue, charm, and a little &#34;magic&#34; of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments Gillian must undergo in her battle with herself, and to win the man she loves. A lovely ending to this beautifully-photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism, though a fantasy, just about complete in my view. Memorably delightful.&#39;,
 &#34;Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it&#39;s pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it&#39;s just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They&#39;re all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it&#39;s over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So said we all.&#34;,
 &#39;A very funny movie. It was good to see Jim Carrey back in top form. It was definitely worth the price of admission. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film. I think they may have played the dog a bit too much however, still a good film to see.&#39;,
 &#34;Bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then slapped silly for this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece. I can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.&#34;,
 &#39;Probably the worst Bollywood film I\&#39;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No plot line. Very little character developments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of silly and pointless humor. The whole film was chaotic and direction-less. There was no proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say &#34;please, just move on with it!!&#34; Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw I\&#39;m not from an Indian background&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#39;,
 &#39;All logic goes straight out of the train window in this British horror film, set in the London underground and starring the usually reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station, only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by &#34;someone&#34; or &#34;something&#34; with killer intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who\&#39;s done better than this \x96 that\&#39;s even including &#34;Erasmus Microman&#34;!.&#39;,
 &#39;To me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies with NO idea of what is going to happen, so therefore I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The real translation, \&#39;The Beating of the Butterfly\&#39;s Wings\&#39;, is oddly not used as the translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans wouldn\&#39;t know what Chaos Theory is (except for those who saw or read &#34;Jurassic Park&#34;). The movie is based on chaos theory, and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead back to one event. The movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect ending. Think to yourself, &#34;what else needed to be said&#34;? It is at the same time a very brave ending. Too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one, but an ending like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;I saw this film on its release, and have watched it 3 or 4 more times, including last week. I regret I have to be a voice of dissension with regard to Mr. Branagh\&#39;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a glorious, sumptuous film, to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designed. Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers, and many others do fine jobs. Then there\&#39;s Kenneth Branagh. If ever there was a vanity project for an actor, this is it, and Mr. Branagh spares nothing in putting the &#34;ham&#34; in Hamlet. From the stunt casting (which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast Jack Lemmon), to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of &#34;naturalness,&#34; to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others. His performance confirms that, while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary, he has never been a great film actor. The scenery budget could be charged to catering, Mr. Branagh eats so much of it. His performance is a perfect example of why people don\&#39;t go to see Shakespeare - &#34;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&#34; And if there is fault to his direction, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what theories people may posit on the Bard, he was, after all is said and done, a playwright. The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. Although there is no &#34;right&#34; way to play his plays, there is most certainly great acting, good acting and bad acting. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of &#34;Hamlet&#34; itself. It amazes me how Mr. Branagh &#34;mouthed&#34; it, but did not hear it. It was an example of spending too much time working out how he\&#39;s going to say something, and too little figuring out WHAT he\&#39;s saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Mr. Branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions, he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it. His direction has always been better than his acting. I still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming Shakespeare. He set a great template for other productions. And, it would be interesting to see him onstage, from about 20 rows back. But, I do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth seeing? Certainly. There are many little joys to be found in the film. But, it\&#39;s a long, long movie and, by the end, one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it.&#39;,
 &#39;This is quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen. Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie &#34;Malevolence&#34; which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director\&#39;s backyard. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The actors were absolutely the WORST. The story didn\&#39;t have anything to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other &#34;mom and pop&#34; store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it. Thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. I have seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn\&#39;t think there was a worse movie than &#34;Troll 2&#34;. Boy was I wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what I am about to do!!!!&#39;,
 &#39;My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can\&#39;t wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I am &#34;old and grey&#34; and still interested in life:-). If anyone has the full lyrics please send them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It\&#39;s great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated, on a par with some of our other favourites, &#34;Spooks&#34; and &#34;Hustle&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, what to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was?? V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point... I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically sick... Round and Round and Round.... You get the idea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY VERY Strange accents at many points.... &#34;Those that should know, know&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it...&#39;,
 &#39;Sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the &#34;classic&#34; 50s &#34;alien invasion&#34; films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail (&#34;Casino Royale&#34;, &#34;Our Man Flint&#34; are worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens, you\&#39;ll be begging for some peace and quiet. (*1/2)&#39;,
 &#34;Mario&#39;s first foray into the world of 3-dimensions is incredible. Miyamoto&#39;s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a Nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it&#39;s charm today. This game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3D adventure/platform games.&#34;,
 &#34;Two sailors are on leave--ladies man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There&#39;s more but you&#39;ve probably guessed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome--gets annoying pretty quick. Also this movie is far too long. It&#39;s 140 minutes and that&#39;s way too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Still this is worth catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won&#39;t care. It&#39;s shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had. The acting is OK--Kelly is fine (although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it) and Sinatra is just great (although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!). Grayson is given nothing to do but she&#39;s incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of her literally took my breath away! There are plenty of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly&#39;s big dancing and singing number; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson&#39;s two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry--an animated mouse! Tom does a funny cameo too. Also there&#39;s little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he&#39;s in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#39;s too long and the plot just doesn&#39;t hold up but it&#39;s still worth catching. This was a huge hit in its day.&#34;,
 &#39;Body Slam (1987) is a flat out terrible movie. The low budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting is lame. But if you\&#39;re into old school wrestling (circa 1970\&#39;s through the mid-80\&#39;) then you\&#39;ll be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. I gave it a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was &#34;directed&#34; by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The synopsis of this &#34;movie&#34; is about a promoter who wants to combine &#34;hair rock&#34; and wrestling. But their are others that don\&#39;t want him to succeed. There\&#39;s more but I don\&#39;t want to SPOIL it for you. If you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline, there\&#39;s a few surprises near the end for die-hard wrestling fans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn\&#39;t recommend this to my worse enemy (and I mean it).&#39;,
 &#39;Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ , but PROXIMITY isn`t that kind of film , it`s more like a &#34; Man on the run &#34; film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Soylent Green&#34; is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70\&#39;s and still very persuasive even by today\&#39;s standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This film\&#39;s quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent\&#39;s most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn\&#39;t really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70\&#39;s cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there\&#39;s a great (but too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton (&#34;Baron Blood&#34;, &#34;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&#34;). THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.&#39;,
 &#39;When I first heard about &#34;Down To Earth,&#34; I was pretty excited. I\&#39;m a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock\&#39;s performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he\&#39;s supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn\&#39;t. Even when he\&#39;s talking to one other character, he seems to think he\&#39;s trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they\&#39;re pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It\&#39;s supposed to be funny because it\&#39;s this white guy telling Chris Rock\&#39;s jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it\&#39;s not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a few moments of laughter can\&#39;t make up for the fact that &#34;Down To Earth&#34; is poorly acted, and poorly directed. This one was a pretty big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 4/10&#39;,
 &#39;What a delightful film...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanied by Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN\&#39;s lush, emotional and dreamy music, this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible casting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character who stole the film was MISS BATES!!! She was mesmerizing to watch, one finds oneself on the edge of ones\&#39; seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages. From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending &#34;that lovely quarter-hind of pork... PORK, MOTHER!!!&#34; she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired Mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson\&#39;s mother, Phyllida Law) who looks forlorn and lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comical ways that Emma would avoid the grating Miss Bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart. We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one\&#39;s heart ripped out to her on her behalf. It is a classic scene, one to be rewound and played over &amp; over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is right up there with &#34;Sense &amp; Sensibility&#34; and provides one of life\&#39;s greatest lessons about how one should marry one\&#39;s best friend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ADORED it!&#39;,
 &#39;The quintessential Georgian film of Georgi Danelia, Ne goryuy (1969) aka Don\&#39;t Grieve is loosely based on the novel by French writer Claude Tillier (1801-1844) &#34;Mon oncle Benjamin&#34; The novel takes place in the country side of the 18th Century France. The Great French Revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society. Benjamin, the local doctor is a soul of a local society, the educated, friendly, democratic person who often treats the poor for free. It makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account. He is in love with a beautiful Manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter &#34;his small capital&#34; and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed... I never read the book, and from description it sounds like a charming very French novel but I am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th Century France to the beginning of 20th century Georgia-Grusiya. I would think that it was Danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native Georgia-Grusiya, the land of long and wonderful traditions, including Art of making and drinking wine, rare music talent that all Georgians seem to possess, very unique humor, and high code of honor. When we watched the film last night together with my husband, he said, what a great example of an Art film, and I so agree with him. Don\&#39;t Grieve is a perfect Art movie, visually beautiful, deep but funny, at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic, celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness, full of interest, loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters. What is the most important, the film is warm and gentle, it does not look down at its viewers as some of the Art pictures do. You don\&#39;t have to be a movie buff to love it, to live with it, to smile and sigh at it, to follow the good-hearted young Doctor Benjamin (first role in a Danelia film of famous singer and actor Wachtang Kikabidze with whom Danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites, Mimino) on his journey through the roads and mountains of Georgia. Or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor Levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake, to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive, and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin. When I watched the film I thought that it is a sort of movie that Federico Fellini might have liked. I was not surprised at all to find the article about Danelia where he names Fellini his number one director. I also found out that according Danelia, the famous Soviet directors, Leonid Gaiday (the creator of many beloved comedies) and Sergei Paraszhanov (the visionary whom I don\&#39;t have to introduce loved another Danelia\&#39;s film, fairy tale about American boy Huck Finn, Sovsem propashchiy) felt and spoke negatively about Don\&#39;t Grieve while Fellini praised it highly. I dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps Maestro Fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of Don\&#39;t Grieve when he was making Amrarcord in 1973. Just a thought, because there is something essential that connects both films. Both Artists came back to their roots, to the places that they love deeply, to the people they remembered, loved and wanted to honor. Both films have a lot of smiles through the tears. Both are Art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers. Both are masterworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to add Georgi Danelia to the list of my favorite directors. He has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy, even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet, poignant and subtle, earthy and uplifting, gentle and shining. When I looked up the list of the movies he has written/directed, I was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the Award winning story of a young boy, Seryozha. Many of Danelia\&#39;s films are among my favorites, as I am sure they are among his legions of fans. The man behind \&#39;Seryozha, Sovsem propashchiy (1972) which is an adaptation of Mark Twain The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 33, Ya shagayu po Moskve (1964) aka Walking the Streets of Moscow, Ne goryuy (1969) aka Don\&#39;t grieve, Afonya (1975), Mimino (1977), Osenniy marafon (1979) aka Autumn Marathon or Sad Comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that Danelia practically invented, and the cult favorite for over 20 years Kin-Dza-Dza (1986), is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness.&#39;,
 &#39;Rip off of &#34;Scream&#34; or especially &#34;I know what you did last summer&#34;, there\&#39;s some entertainment here, and a little scary, but they needed some originality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An entertainment score? 6.5/10 Overall? 5.5/10&#39;,
 &#39;Follow-up to 1973\&#39;s &#34;Walking Tall&#34; continues the real-life drama surrounding Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment plays like a lame TV-movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but he\&#39;s much too mild for the part; he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 by &#34;Final Chapter-Walking Tall&#34; and in 1978 by the television film &#34;A Real American Hero&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;I have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that periodically appear on this film\&#39;s IMDb space. I saw this movie courtesy of subway cinema\&#39;s new york Asian film festival (which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year, see vital, snake of june, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style)and have regretted every day that a scene from that movie disengorges itself from the back of my mind, and becomes a vivid memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m sure that you can read a laudatory summary of the film off of Subway Cinema, which is probably why I made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film. The description built up the kind of horror film that I had longed for for a while, one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares. P was in fact different. It relied on cheap laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as &#34;Lesbians team up to fight monsters.&#34; Completely untrue. There is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This film seems like a short made for &#34;Are you afraid of the dark?&#34; The story is ridiculous, and only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally rescinded their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the $9 that they wasted at the door. I almost wish paul spurrier was in the audience so that I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad softcore horror-cum-porn that belongs on the spice channel, which only succeeded to get the actress excommunicated from her family, and caused a minor stir at the belgium film festival. The only stir that this caused was a gurgle in the lower intestine as it couldn\&#39;t extract itself from the sh*te that it is. Anyway, I hope I can dissaude anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film, it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences, knocking out soulplane for the number 2.&#39;,
 &#34;Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France&#39;s most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that&#39;s on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general&#39;s handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it&#39;s Rules of the Game redux. Before it&#39;s all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply humane Renoir masterpiece.&#34;,
 &#34;I think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30&#39;s take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a little confusing. What drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. Why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I don&#39;t know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is insufferable. By the way, a more apt title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized.&#34;,
 &#34;Now i really liked this movie, it was so funny.Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch, he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy&#39;s like this one in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really Good actor. i just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone.&#34;,
 &#39;I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that\&#39;s exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in &#34;The Best of Times&#34;. Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in &#34;Good Morning, Vietnam&#34; is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn\&#39;t just going to go along with it so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it\&#39;s not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least). Check it out.&#39;,
 &#39;Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development. There are no such shows now, but rather &#34;Housewife&#34; sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that I can\&#39;t help but think that Rod Serling was tailoring that long ago week\&#39;s show around Elam, even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story. This episode ends with a twist, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with especially &#34;Serlingesque&#34; dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rex Lewis Field&#39;,
 &#39;Where to begin? How about with the erroneous synopsis: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine\&#39;s epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non-violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it\&#39;s difficult to understand how they have any connection at all. We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run, to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan, and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all. Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We are thrown into a romance so fast that it\&#39;s over before you can blink an eye. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later. We are left wondering why we should care about this. Who was she anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story, the romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed in simply because it was required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth. Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the weapon X program, lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running. Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple. Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent aren\&#39;t alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder what fate awaits them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the previous films and the comic books, the main reason that Wolverines\&#39; amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing this was the case...did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As hinted to in X2: X-men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together. This film sets up the team fairly well only they don\&#39;t really do much of anything. No disturbing violence, no ruthless actions, they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that Wolverine wasn\&#39;t an evil man under Stryker at all. Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was. Eventually he just leaves all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No conflict of duality here at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely. They may as well have given him rubber claws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic memory-erasing bullets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine. Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all. Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story. Most were in the film for 5-10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred Dukes (the Blob but not the comic version) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all, but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclops optic beams (which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers) can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes. Adamantium trench coats anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (gravity defying) mutant Gambit, instead of utilizing his signature cards, is made into some sort of crazy acrobat. In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine...then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran away a few blocks, climbed up a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash. The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comic book source material, the REAL origin of Wolverine...is a story worth bringing to the screen. It doesn\&#39;t sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies. It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time, began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This FOX film should seriously be forgotten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have that magic gun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#39;,
 &#34;I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original Timecop. Lots of things from Timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. This story is taking place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them aren&#39;t... only the first one is great... and there aren&#39;t many action scenes at all, and they&#39;re all pretty short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point in the story, the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes... no wait, make that two times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: Don&#39;t waste time watching this movie, it&#39;s not worth it&#34;,
 &#34;Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. Only Hawn&#39;s well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. Goldie&#39;s gotta be a contender for an actress who&#39;s done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#34;Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba&#39;s palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke&#39;s Jedi powers, they have the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it&#39;s only just of the pace of the first two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;,
 &#34;Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I&#39;m one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry, I&#39;ll not recommend this one to anyone.&#34;,
 &#39;Watching &#34;Der himmel über Berlin&#34; as a teen in the late 80\&#39;s was a profound experience for me - &#34;so this was what the movies could be&#34;. Along with &#34;Paris, Texas&#34; and &#34;Until the End of the World&#34; it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with &#34;Million Dollar Hotel&#34; and &#34;Land of Plenty&#34; hitting a terrible low point. Gone are the captivating pictures or music. No search for or display of great insight. All that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements, that boils down to nothing but clichés, and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has the well run dry? Whatever the reason, it\&#39;s time for Mr. Wenders to either step it up or stop altogether.&#39;,
 &#34;Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. That&#39;s Greenaway&#39;s big problem. He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill isn&#39;t enough. He&#39;s just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.&#34;,
 &#39;Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Highly recommended.&#39;,
 &#39;Larry Buchanan. Yep, same guy who did &#34;Attack of the THE Eye Creatures&#34; and two (count \&#39;em: TWO) conspiracy movies about Marilyn Monroe. He\&#39;s to blame, here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding onto his ever-growing pile of folders left over from Oliver Stone\&#39;s &#34;eh-I-grew-out-of-it&#34; conspiracy drawer, here\&#39;s &#34;Down On Us (i.e.- &#34;Beyond the Doors&#34;) which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget everything you THOUGHT you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar\&#39;, cuz this is the real deal! Y\&#39;see, the three big names in rock of the \&#39;60s were KILLED BY THE GOVERNMENT because they were subversives or counter-productive to Truth, Justice and the American Way, or sumpthin\&#39; like that there. I knew it all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look eerily like their real life shadows (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn your backs and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths, the good old US of A put hits out on them! Yep, it\&#39;s the truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, I cannot believed I watched this movie. It\&#39;s facts, when not stretching credibility to the snapping point, are ludicrous; the acting makes TV commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end, you deserve the &#34;twist&#34; ending. You really, really do; I swear. Genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like the man said: &#34;Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this flick, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stars for &#34;Down on Us&#34;. And that\&#39;s the movie audience describing the film, by the way....&#39;,
 &#34;As someone who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler&#39;s psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler&#39;s state of mind. In this the series does quite well. Carlyle is very good as is O&#39;Toole, I would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels, Goring and Hess&#39;s mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people research the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.&#34;,
 &#34;Was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had a great chat to Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife.Fantastic after party too. Then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant film, it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can&#39;t get enough of it neither can the kids. Get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think I&#39;m a film star now oh well one can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we was in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck&#34;,
 &#39;it\&#39;s a weekend i\&#39;ve been watched this funny film. and i really like it. all the kids are cute, who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking. it\&#39;s a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night, which could make lots of memories and laughters. Kid\&#39;s humor always work. nice acting as well. simple story but cool shooting. nice job for directer to find the kid\&#39;s way. when it comes to the kid movie, i think of &#34;12 and holding&#34;. another one this year but differed aspect to the kid\&#39;s world, which is real and cruel. awesome work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every kid and family need. p.s. Twitch, i think, is the voice of Nemo from &#34;Finding Nemo&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Kitten Natividad, of Russ Meyer film fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) that is supposed to have healing powers. After going down on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that she\&#39;s also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, that all sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she\&#39;s taking away their business so some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer film fame) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the guise of the Double D Avenger. Watch her do a &#34;Wonder Woman&#34; type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow. With the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70\&#39;s &#34;live action&#34; kid\&#39;s show with adult content, although while this is unrated it could probably get away with PG-13 at the worst. And it\&#39;s probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered. This makes Doris Wishman\&#39;s Chesty Morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison. Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman but so what. Very stupid, and I\&#39;m never buying another film with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.&#39;,
 &#34;I just want to say that this production is very one sided, breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no credits of the persons they interviewed, so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tells the story from just one point of view. To do this is very dangerous, because the next generations learns the bad idea, and thats why wars keep coming. I know this is not the only reason about wars, but doesn&#39;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can watch this documentary, but read in the internet a lot, before. Balcans are complex as human history is.&#34;,
 &#34;The only remarkable fact is the participation of Klaus Kinski who plays a priest. Don&#39;t ask me why he does it! A bad, bad movie overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m sorry, but this is such a bad movie it\&#39;s hilarious. Football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge? Suits? Shades?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this, it is as far from the truth as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casting was atrocious...Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? He doesn\&#39;t look scary, act scary or even come across as someone who would like football. And as for Yeti? What the hell? Suits, shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with &#34;its about time you got your nappy on&#34;. Please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the Yeti\&#39;s gang spraying the ICC\&#39;s underwear? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t see how anyone can even take this film seriously!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10. Its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen.&#39;,
 &#34;This was a good movie. It wasn&#39;t your typical war flick but something a bit different. This movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war. This film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made. Colin Farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well. Seeing Colin Farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years, You would never thought it would happen. I will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch. Its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr.&#34; is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as &#34;Glen or Glenda&#34;, &#34;Bride of the Monster&#34;, and, of course, &#34;Plan 9 from Outer Space&#34;. This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as &#34;Look Back in Angora&#34; and &#34;The Plan 9 Companion&#34;, failed. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Ed\&#39;s life and untimely death for the viewer. Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.&#39;,
 &#39;....because if I was, I may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross! I\&#39;m still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I\&#39;m being &#34;generous&#34; that there was even a plot to begin with. As previously mentioned, it\&#39;s a misnomer on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star. He was barely in the movie. And if he was indeed &#34;frustrated&#34; as the back cover indicated he was, well, that\&#39;s probably because he said YES to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn\&#39;t get out of it! The movie really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what his role in the movie was supposed to be, other than the extreme close -ups, was not as big of a mystery as to what Gene Barry\&#39;s role actually was - or wasn\&#39;t. And speaking of &#34;big&#34;...whomever had the bright idea to fit Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty attire, which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin, should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober. I could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was, from the dialogue not matching the &#34;actors\&#39;&#34; mouths (think Clutch Cargo), to the erratic jumping from scene to scene (again, being generous even calling the frames of pictures &#34;scenes&#34;), to the lack of a plot.... However, if you\&#39;re into bad early 70s genre and if you\&#39;re in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid &amp; cat pictures, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you\&#39;ll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day!&#39;,
 &#39;Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. The death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton did great as the female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the &#34;I Know...&#34; films). David Boreanaz, whom is the main reason I saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was horrible in this. The only scene I was glad to see her in was *SPOILER* her death scene. All in all, it\&#39;s a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before you watch &#34;Scream&#34; or &#34;I Know...&#34; again.&#39;,
 &#39;In this truly fascinating, dark film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil takes his mirror image (this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when Balduin, the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a &#34;man at war with himself&#34; which portents his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he has made a pact with the devil, he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money, you cannot have both. Balduin is haunted by his double (the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action. Some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of doom when the Devil disappears with Balduin\&#39;s mirror image is amazing, as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society (the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the \&#39;wasteland\&#39; at the edge of the town, no longer entirely human (he has lost his soul) he is like a hunted animal outside of human society. There are so many other things to say about this incredible film. Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, a cultural hero of mine. It helps if you know a bit about German history at the time this film was made and about German doppelganger tradition (don\&#39;t google it, get a proper book)Just remember, it\&#39;s a very early film, it\&#39;s a little clumsy at times, but considering what it has to say and it\&#39;s tragic finale, it\&#39;s one of the best ever (yes it Is!)&#39;,
 &#39;I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after seeing the FANTASTIC 2001 live action version of the film. The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtably be far better than George Lucas\&#39; Star Wars &#34;prequel&#34; trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I didn\&#39;t quite understand the depth of the film at that time. Now that I have read the books, I understand what the whole storyline is all about. To be sure, some of the characters are quite silly, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)) but, I have to say it follows the book rather closely, and it goes into part of book two, The Two Towers. The good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it\&#39;s time. The bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through The Two Towers without any result of Frodo\&#39;s quest to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks quite dated compared to today\&#39;s standards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not AS bad as many say it is. BUT, the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter! I\&#39;ll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter anyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 7 out of a scale of 1-10, far LESS violent than the 2001 live action version, but NOWHERE near as good! For diehard fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.&#39;,
 &#39;This movie is a cringe-fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot. But it is so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. They catch up with him in the year 1146. The \&#39;futuristic\&#39; lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a bunch of \&#39;futuristic\&#39; flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which isn\&#39;t hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-shakers like &#34; I double-checked everything twice!&#34; He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I guess chain mail wasn\&#39;t on the budget, \&#39;cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. The fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.It sounds truly awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous B-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, I would suggest you see. And once you have, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them point out all the funny, truly awful bits in the movie.&#39;,
 &#39;First, let\&#39;s get the &#34;hoopla&#34; out of the way.Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.Here we have Hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native Austrian.I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic.Yes we see a brief close up of Hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming &amp; runaway horse scenes naked, the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of branches, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so don\&#39;t go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.Her boyfriend , Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times.Yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water, farm machinery, landscapes etc.Sweet sounding strings run for most of &#34;Extase\&#39;s&#34; length and the film has a &#34;feel&#34; of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.The script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did Eva see in him anyway?Money?), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.She then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.After a ride on her horse Eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse\&#39;s saddle.However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.Hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.And so the romance is born.Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva, later decides to shoot himself but I thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a 1990 reissue title on VHS, the sound being 70 years old, is a bit soft and with background crackles, in line with films of its age.After a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with Eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930\&#39;s vintage.This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.I gave it 7/10.&#39;,
 &#34;Despite its stereotypes, virtually &#39;no-name&#39; cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn&#39;t help thinking, though, that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like. Maybe it&#39;s just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#39;s not a &#39;must see&#39; or a great film by any standard, &#39;Fatal Error&#39; is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.&#34;,
 &#34;Though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that&#39;s less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn&#39;t have the charisma of Ray Milland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present, popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#39;s another endless night for BD as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining.&#34;,
 &#34;Dressed to Kill starts off with Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) having a sexually explicit nightmare, later on that day she visits her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated &amp; unfulfilled in her current marriage. Kate then visits a museum &amp; picks up a stranger, they go back to his apartment for casual sex, when done Kate is set to leave but is attacked &amp; killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman. Prostitute Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) discovers the gruesome scene &amp; sees the killer but manages to escape. Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) says he suspects Liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so Liz teams up with Kate&#39;s son Peter (Keith Gordon) to track down the real killer, clear Liz&#39;s name &amp; see that justice is done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written &amp; directed by Brian De Palma I thought Dressed to Kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery. The script is measured &amp; slow at times but it likes to focus on the character&#39;s so you really know them, the entire first twenty minutes is just developing Kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off, then the film switches it&#39;s attentions to Liz &amp; no one else gets a look in. This way Dressed to Kill is quite absorbing &amp; engaging, unfortunately the character&#39;s themselves aren&#39;t exactly likable. I found some of the dialogue quite funny at times, especially the dirty talk that Liz spouts occasionally. The killers motives are somewhat plausible but I guess you&#39;d have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in Dressed to Kill. It&#39;s a good film but it didn&#39;t excite me that much &amp; I didn&#39;t really find any character to root for or like. The film tacks on a needless &amp; unnecessary twist ending that I didn&#39;t really see the point of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director De Palma directs with style &amp; visual flair, from the art museum sequence to a car chase &amp; as a whole it&#39;s impeccably filmed throughout. I&#39;d imagine that every shot in Dressed to Kill had a great deal of thought put into it. I felt the film was a bit flat &amp; uninspired at times though, nothing about it really excited me that much. There is a fair bit of nudity, some sex &amp; rape along with a few bits of gore &amp; violence, Kate&#39;s murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight, if that&#39;s the right word. However, it&#39;s by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a supposed budget of about $6,500,000 Dressed to Kill has that glossy high production value feel of a Hollywood film. The New York locations are nice, the cinematography is good &amp; as a whole it&#39;s extremely well made. I thought the music was inappropriate &amp; was far to loud &amp; intrusive. The acting is OK but despite his top billing I didn&#39;t think Caine had that much screen time. Allen was married to director De Palma at the time Dressed to Kill was made, interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by De Palma in two of them, this &amp; Blow Out (1981), he cast her as a prostitute... A body double was used for Dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed to Kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but I didn&#39;t think it quite lived up to it&#39;s lofty reputation. Good but not brilliant.&#34;,
 &#39;All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon, and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn\&#39;t get within five miles, about eight kilometers, of an actual movie. BOY does this thing suck. There isn\&#39;t one original line, thought, shot, or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close. The magical, ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. Usually it\&#39;s in the opening credits - &#34;Written, Directed, and Produced by&#34; one guy. Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there\&#39;s one and only one reason this turkey got made. Here, you don\&#39;t find out till the very last of the credits, where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I\&#39;m watching MST\&#39;s take on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.&#39;,
 &#39;I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate movies below a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. There\&#39;s a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What\&#39;s happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. &#34;Oh no, it\&#39;s dark, look out behind you&#34; I say, quite bored with the cheap thrills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. &#34;This was good until the end.... Then it just got silly&#34;, says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You\&#39;ve had amazing films, but this one sunk.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;ve seen this film in avant-premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, I was waiting to see the final result. I haven\&#39;t been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. Clearly inspired by some comic books, such as the ones from F. Miller. In this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent &#34;Sin City&#34; adaptation from R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no Grey or any middle color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film.(can\&#39;t wait for scanner darkly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. The direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end. Despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations)the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms...)gives this movie a great interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it is an animated film, this one is obviously not made for children. You won\&#39;t find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. It is far closer to a good film noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film: we still feel the well known Paris, but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I regret a few mistakes. The montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs. Even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like &#34;final fantasy&#34; did). Those little things makes it a 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckyly, they didn\&#39;t ask John Woo to do the job!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, it is a film with blasting visuals, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. Watch it if you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.&#39;,
 &#39;After having watched &#34;Guinea Pig&#34;, two questions come in mind ( besides \&#39;Am I really a psychopath to watch that ?\&#39; ) : \&#39;Is it a snuff ?\&#39; The answer is no ; although it\&#39;s the closest thing to a snuff movie I\&#39;ve ever seen. And then : \&#39;Where the hell have they found that girl ?\&#39;. Because she gets tortured for \&#39;45 min, without any reasons given ( in fact, there is nothing else in this movie !) : Fingernails teared off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested by maggots, ... and many more until the final scene ( I\&#39;m still not sure how they did that ). Because it belongs to the \&#39;japonese underground scene\&#39;, it\&#39;s obvious she didn\&#39;t get a lot of money. So what were her ( their ) motivations ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it in japonese without subtitles, but it\&#39;s not a problem ( no real dialogues, the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). I haven\&#39;t seen yet all the serial, but the first &#34;Guinea Pig&#34; is not known for being the best one. Still I\&#39;ve rated 8, because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff, the issue is quite good ( ask Charlie Sheen, the actor ). But I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another movie I\&#39;m hiding from my parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#39;,
 &#39;This was the worst film i have seen for a long time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls are nice though, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film seems to be a very bad made sex ad, made for an audience that is not older than 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never visited an American college, but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your time, do something else.&#39;,
 &#39;From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can\&#39;t find his way) &#34;Finding John Christmas&#34; is better left lost. Ms. Bertinelli\&#39;s performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray\&#39;s script is juvenile at best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;, Ernst Lubitsch\&#39;s delightful &#34;The shop around the corner&#34; and, of course the 1951 version of &#34;Scrooge&#34;. There\&#39;s Frank Capra\&#39;s classics &#34;It\&#39;s a wonderful life&#34; and &#34;Meet John Doe&#34;. Hey, forget the classics. What about &#34;Home Alone&#34; or &#34; Home for the Holidays&#34; with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding &#34;Finding John Christmas&#34;. Merry Christmas!&#39;,
 &#39;First, I should mention that I really enjoyed ISHII Katsuhito\&#39;s previous film &#34;Samehada Otoko to Momojiri Onna&#34; (&#34;Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl&#34;). Although it owed a debt to Tarentino\&#39;s &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34;, Ishii\&#39;s cast was up to the task of carrying the story, and the entire film crackled with energy. The scenes between ASANO Tadanobu and GASHUIN Tatsuya were particularly engaging. There was action, intrigue, bizarre characterizations, enough sex to keep things interesting, and an utterly unpredictable story line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that I began to watch &#34;Party 7&#34;. And my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits, which left my wife and I actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were; the mix of anime and live-action work was brilliant! Then, the actual movie started. Actually, it didn\&#39;t so much &#34;start&#34; as sort of shuffle in the side door and stand there, fumbling through its pockets, looking uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire film takes place in three rooms. One is a futuristic voyeur\&#39;s paradise (borrowed a bit from &#34;Shark Skin Man...&#34;), another is a travel agent\&#39;s office, and the third (and far the most used) is a seedy hotel room. In that room, a cast of seven characters meets and...does approximately nothing. Really. I\&#39;m no stranger to &#34;talking&#34; films. One of my all-time favorites is &#34;My Dinner with Andre&#34;, the talkiest of all talking films. &#34;My Dinner with Andre&#34; is far more exciting, and it just has two middle-aged men discussing their lives over dinner. The key is that Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn tell interesting stories. The cast of &#34;Party 7&#34; literally just whine at each other for the entire film. &#34;No, you don\&#39;t!&#34; &#34;Yes, I do!&#34; &#34;No, you really don\&#39;t!&#34; &#34;Yes, I really do!&#34; &#34;No, you really, really don\&#39;t!&#34; Yes, I really...&#34; you get the idea, I hope. I wish the directer had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Party 7 is an unbelievably unengaging film. There is only the flimsiest of plots (money stolen from the Yakuza, just like in &#34;Shark Skin Man...&#34;), accompanied by almost no action. There is no interesting dialog. The characters are largely uninteresting. It was as if Ishii took the throwaway conversational moments from Tarentino\&#39;s films and built an entire film around them. But Tarentino\&#39;s conversations always have their own internal logic and wit (&#34;They call it a \&#39;Royale, with cheese\&#39;&#34;). Not so with the dialog here, which is duller than you can imagine. If it weren\&#39;t for the brief, hilarious cameo from Gashuin (who is always marvelous) and a low-key performance from the awesome ASANO Tadanobu, I would\&#39;ve given &#34;Party 7&#34; a single star. It really was chore to make it all the way through.&#39;,
 &#34;Peaceful rancher Robert Sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors, that is until notorious outlaw Robert Preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field. Soon he begins to go too far, feeding a growing sense of unease in Sterling, especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sundowners is a tightly-paced, gritty, and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by Preston. Here, he comes across as an evil version of Shane, that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw&#39;s relationship is revealed. Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rounding out the cast is Chill Wills, Jack Elam, and the debut of John Drew Barrymore, who became more famous for his offspring than his acting.&#34;,
 &#34;This series got me into Deighton&#39;s writing and the genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of the story. I would however disagree with the above comment. From what I have read in the past, it is not Holm&#39;s performance that lead Deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen. A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson&#39;s field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish frontier. This whole storyline is cloth. The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm&#39;s performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife&#39;s defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide. Samson both pays for his father&#39;s idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department. I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is diminutive when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence.&#34;,
 &#34;Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, drawing an X rating. By today&#39;s standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating. Jon Voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more so than in this portrayal. He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth seeing for Hoffman&#39;s performance alone.&#34;,
 &#34;A failure. The movie was just not good. It has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at. I mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies. The movie should have been aired as a Disney Channel original movie, that is FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda&#39;s Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter&#39;s, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10. If I gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Pandora\&#39;s Clock&#34; is a gripping suspense/thriller that\&#39;s a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film. This movie, which aired in two parts on NBC in its debut showing in 1996, is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease. The U.S. Government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. I\&#39;m not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked &#34;Pandora\&#39;s Clock&#34;. It\&#39;s one heck of a thrill ride. Jane Leeves (TV\&#39;s &#34;Frasier&#34;), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as the President) also star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** (out of four)&#39;,
 &#39;I saw this many years after the television series and, initially, I didn\&#39;t care for it. Then, as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time, I watched again, and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the stage play by Neil Simon, it has not been \&#39;opened out\&#39; much for the big screen, and that\&#39;s one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast are wonderful, particularly John Fielder as \&#39;Vinnie\&#39;. Even now, certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar cracking up and chasing Felix around the apartment, the giggling \&#39;Pigeon Sisters\&#39; brought low by Felix\&#39;s sob stories, and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene ( later ripped off by Nora Ephron\&#39;s \&#39;When Harry Met Sally\&#39; ). Razor-sharp dialogue too. When the boys think Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says: &#34;They could be vitamins! He could be the healthiest one in the room!&#34;. Fantastic!&#39;,
 &#34;For all the hoopla, respect and recognition this film gets from Kung Fu historians, it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas: action and fight scenes. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I&#39;ve ever seen in a martial arts film. Five Deadly Venoms without a doubt is a must see, not only that, a movie you can watch again and again; but I also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better. It somehow leaves you wanting something, you want more. The producer Chang Cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn&#39;t follow through with giving us more of the action we want. The fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer (Centipede,Snake,Scorpion,Lizard,Toad) and they are shown, but battles are noticeably short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much, much more, in fact the Toad is killed off by the middle of the movie. Interestingly enough with this movie, the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome. This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel. To start off the movie and to introduce the Poison Clan producer Chang Cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon. The ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more. Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the movie would conclude with this: The styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail, sad thing is , the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn&#39;t expand on it. I am left wondering what could have been with this movie, still one of the best though. 8 out of 10 on the scale.&#34;,
 &#39;Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington\&#39;s perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is made in two parts, there\&#39;s the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing\&#39;s wrong, everyone\&#39;s just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there\&#39;s the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy\&#39;s recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and &#34;La Hermamdad&#34; that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn\&#39;t been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10&#39;,
 &#39;Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did, I love this show! I think that it has been very well done and thought through. Everything about it marks it as a spin-off which isn\&#39;t meant to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy. By using the well known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs which have annoyed fans. The classic being the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts from the 80\&#39;s. These spin-offs had their place: They allowed new content to be sold, created new fans, and kept Scooby-Doo merchandise on the shelves. I would agree that &#34;Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!&#34; doesn\&#39;t fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what I had always wanted the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action packed show which focuses on the best/funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad-guys, the &#34;Best Friend&#34; relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humour! Bad features: None, although the revamped Mystery Machine is pretty close at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the cleverest cartoons in a long time!&#39;,
 &#34;Clint Tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter, tho he finds her, the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim. Whilst here, the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of Tollinger&#39;s reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer. As they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit, they hold a meeting that chooses to hire Tollinger to rid the town of it&#39;s unsavoury elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man With The Gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one, at the time of me writing this, it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it. It&#39;s a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a B movie Western, this is a fine entry in the Western genre. That the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel, probably hasn&#39;t done the film any favours over the years, i myself read the synopsis and thought it&#39;s just another in the line of similarly themed pictures. Yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments, both technically and as a functioning story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Mitchum is in the lead as Tollinger, perfectly cast, he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace. We often talk about the screen presence that John Wayne and Charlton Heston had {justifiably of course}, Mitchum is right up there with the best of them. One sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place, we don&#39;t see his face, but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us!. The rest of the cast are also very much in Mitchum&#39;s shadow, so really it&#39;s solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high, perhaps it&#39;s unfair to single out Ted de Corsia for a kick, but Man With The Gun&#39;s minor failings are with its villains, and sadly de Corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace. The score from Alex North is excellently layered {fans of Spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up} and the cinematography from Lee Garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot. Directed and co-written by first time director Richard Wilson, Man With The Gun holds few surprises for the genre, but it&#39;s dark in tone, violent and above all else, highly watchable. 7.5/10&#34;,
 &#39;Atlantis was much better than I had anticipated. In some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age. Although this film did demand a soid attention span at times. It was a great film for all ages. I noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. A lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies. After a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching Atlantis.&#39;,
 &#34;This cute animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well here he does speak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop&#39;s pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie is about development. People growing and people fading, people surprising and people disappointing. It has it all and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.&#39;,
 &#39;Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially &#34;stage&#34; dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the film, and worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the &#34;Chin up&#34; exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns &amp; Allen will find it worth bearing up under the &#34;plot&#34;. I\&#39;ve seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.&#39;,
 &#34;Pointless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia&#39;s greatest exports on screen. Roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time.&#34;,
 &#39;At first look of the plot tagline I figured it could have been a decent film. Could I have ever been more wrong? The beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film. For the first 10 minutes you don\&#39;t notice the cheesy acting, horrible sound and god-awful special effects, but then it gets worse. Just about 20 minutes into it I was asking myself, &#34;What was the plot again?&#34; I could only ask that question when I wasn\&#39;t busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film. The main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film, even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in-between. The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re-live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie. Now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off Morpheus from &#34;The Matrix,&#34; although he is doing just a horrible job. The actor\&#39;s talking about &#34;Star Wars&#34; and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. Now at the end of the movie you don\&#39;t realize that it\&#39;s the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing. The &#34;Morpheus&#34; character dies, the ONLY good thing about the movie. He utters a couple words and the credits roll. What is this? No plot, bad acting, cheesy everything, it couldn\&#39;t get any worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!&#39;,

 &#34;What fun! Bucketfuls of good humor, terrific cast chemistry (Skelton/Powell/Lahr/O&#39;Brien), dynamite Dorsey-driven soundtrack! Miss Powell&#39;s dance numbers have exceptional individual character and pizzazz. Her most winning film appearance.&#34;,
 &#39;This version of the Charles Dickens novel features George C Scott as the Scrooge. Fine casting, especially the choice of Scott, who plays the role to the hilt..a fine cast supports him in the very good adaption. A Modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten..9&#39;,
 &#39;But this movie was a bore. The history part was fine but the musical part was not. Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Sweet Jesus&#34; was suppose to be comic relief it never work. If John Adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one, the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shouldn\&#39;t you be humming the songs after a musical, except for a few chirps, nothing else was worth the breath.&#39;,
 &#39;(There are Spoilers) Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer,takes over the life and car of 18 virgin, even though he\&#39;s too embarrassed to admit it, collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the movie Myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him, or her,in order to keep from ending up turning into one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanging around a trucker rest-stop Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action, in the back seat of his buggy. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is non other then his estranged daughter! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to get it on with him Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student Trent Colbert who plows into the rest-area side swiping one of the truckers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing her chance Miya jumps into Trent\&#39;s car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie. Going all across the North Eastern USA the two end up involved in a truck car smash-up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to Trent\&#39;s parents home, with them being held hostage. It\&#39;s there that there\&#39;s another wild shootout between the crazed Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would expect a movie like &#34;Hit and Run&#34; to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but it\&#39;s not. In fact the film is very disturbing in how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child-molesting father Roy. Getting Trent to drive her all over the North-East Miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room, together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle. Miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny Mr. Foster by tricking him into giving her his gun, as being part of some weird sex game. After holding Foster up she takes off with Trent\&#39;s, who out cold in his motel room, wallet with some $400.00 in it yet doesn\&#39;t bother to drive away with his car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on his cellphone from Miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back. Like the jerk that he is Trent picks up Miya, who\&#39;s now a fugitive from he law, and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway as he tries to run both Trent &amp; Miya off the road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chase ends up in this deserted wear-house that Roy chases Miya,out running him on a muddy road in high-heels, into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With both a holdup and murder, as well as a hit and run, charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a S&amp;M/Tattoo boutique where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains, by Myri, together with a matching his and hers dog collar. This in order to meet his straight-laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a running shootout with the state troopers, with one of them ending up badly injured,the two fugitives from the law end up at Trent\&#39;s parents Mr &amp; Mrs Colbet, David Keith &amp; Elaine Martyn home with the entire local police force, with a SWAT team, waiting for them there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying,if at all, to tell it\&#39;s audience. You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first but as the movie rolled along to it\&#39;s downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in Death Valley. Even though Roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended Miya totally eclipsed him.&#39;,
 &#34;Fräulein Doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in Western Europe has declined in the past 40 years. Then, in the late 60s, while the big Hollywood studios were on the ropes, Italy,France and England were turning out movies to fill the void left by Hollywood&#39;s decline. There were the James Bond pictures (Doctor No was a surprise hit in the USA, it was first released at the Century theater chain in NYC with a 99 cent afternoon admission price), the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns (with A Fistful of Dollars released by a distributor that never paid the Italian producers a dime)and French crime movies that usually went to art houses, with exceptions like The Sicilian Clan. And there were European co-productions like Doctor Zhivago and, of course, Fräulein Doktor. With its big budget for the time, and the world talent involved, Fräulein Doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenneth More, playing a British intelligence officer, has a line in Fräulein Doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the Wall Game. The wall being opposite a firing squad, with little chance of the spy winning the game. That sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders, in the Vietnam War era of 1969.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamy scenes between Suzy Kendall and Capucine probably did not damage these performers&#39; chances at getting parts in Hollywood movies, Hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses. Fox would no longer co-produce films like The Sicilian Clan, Columbia wouldn&#39;t distribute films like Belmondo&#39;s The Night Caller. MGM went even further, cutting almost all film production, selling its chain of theaters in India for the value of the land underneath and unloading its Borehamwood studio facilty as Kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in Las Vegas (where a Bally casino gift shop sold MGM memorabilia at giveaway prices, stuff left over from the auction of MGM&#39;s prop warehouses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paramount distributed Fräulein Doktor, but Gulf and Western&#39;s Charles Bludhorn, who had taken over the company and canned the studio&#39;s aged Board of Directors, unloaded the studio&#39;s film library to Universal (as I recall) and really became interested in movies after production chief Robert Evans started turning out one hit after another. But that was in the 70s. Fräulein Doktor with its lesbian scene was buried, with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenneth More was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older, especially in the BBC detective series Father Brown. When he was younger, as in the British movie Titanic, he played his standard reserved British officer. In Fräulein Doktor, he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual, as I recall. It would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate, about his role and, of course, those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle. That was some scene, and Alberto Lattuada showed he was some director, helming this World War I espionage movie, where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen.&#34;,
 &#39;Lil Bush is a 30 minute cartoon show comprised of 2 15 minutes episodes shown on Comedy Central. It takes place in a fictional, cartoonish Washington D.C., and centers around the satirical, childish representations of George W. Bush, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney. Other politicians are also satirized in the same manner, and act as minor characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pilot of little Bush, much to this commentator\&#39;s expectations, proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production, which barely delivers on its featured promise: a satirical look at the current presidential administration. While one must admit that premise of the show does have SOME merit, even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired, execution that can only be described as sloppy at best, and downright awful at worst, has marred what little potential the show had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lil Bush, which may be technically classified as &#34;satire&#34;, tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar (but not particularly original, entertaining, or funny) ways. The show\&#39;s consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording Bush/Cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television. As such, most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clichés, some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already. Comparing the Vice President to Darth Vader, for example, may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the Daily Show/Colbert Report/Letterman/Conan O\&#39;Brien/Leno monologue/any late-night-talk-show-ever, but it is not funny here. As if that were not enough, the show\&#39;s plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old, tiresome Bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the show\&#39;s defense, when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke (which seems to be a rarity) it is often somewhat humorous. If the show were to expand its depth somewhat, and place its characters into new situations, exotic situations, rather than the same old mistakes and &#34;quagmires&#34; perpetuated by the Bush administration, therefore not having to rely on the same old Bush jokes over and over again, the show might be considered somewhat tolerable, and possibly even innovative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the Lil Bush series the most damage; its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality, or its painfully narrow minded ambitions. It is reasonable to expect that Lil Bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans, that is, if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing; so long as the program continues to lampoon the Bush administration thoroughly. Even so, the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is, a weak and pointlessly vulgar attempt at satire, and tune out in search of something more intellectually stimulation; The Price is Right, perhaps.&#39;,
 &#34;I cannot vote on this because I wouldn&#39;t watch garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it&#39;s my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time. One guy even responds to himself ...using the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it&#39;s as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane...Not even close (by no means). If this is the company&#39;s 2nd movie, it should be better than the first. That means the 3rd movie should be a lot better. Not so, I&#39;ve seen it. All I want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine...but don&#39;t try to market that trash!&#34;,
 &#39;Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California...and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesn\&#39;t give off the impression of having high regard for the \&#39;40s films his &#34;Chandler&#34; was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this \&#39;70s variant on the \&#39;private dick\&#39; archetype, but the movie doesn\&#39;t have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Caron\&#39;s hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *1/2 from ****&#39;,
 &#34;Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. While its clear why Dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-Hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, Dawson seems out of place in the role. Forgive me I simply couldn&#39;t find her. Thats not a mistake, thats how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes I know she&#39;s on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. I blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn&#39;t seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which I would love to talk about but can&#39;t cause it would spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.What can I say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it&#39;s time I can&#39;t get back. For Rosario Dawson fans only, though be warned there&#39;s several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario- please, you&#39;re a better actress, pick better scripts)&#34;,
 &#34;Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son&#39;s place unexpectedly.His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left his father.Ben&#39;s wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go see a farmhouse that&#39;s for sale.But that&#39;s not the end of their journey.Their road trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father.Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005).Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job.The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing.And he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it&#39;s this good.Who would be better man to play the father than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can tell you that.And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part.Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh.And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.It&#39;s just hilarious when they go fishing.And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick.The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times.But it can also be touching from time to time.You couldn&#39;t tell a story any better than it is told here.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;The Bank&#34; (1915, Chaplin) &#34;The Bank&#34; was one of Charlie\&#39;s 1915 Essanay films. While these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts, this one seems a bit below average. The gag with the janitorial double combo-locked vault and the tough-luck ending that has Charlie waking up from a dream, in which he is stroking the lead lady\&#39;s hair, only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow, are both classic Chaplin moments. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co-worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and Charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie\&#39;s alter-ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn\&#39;t with his own two hands. Interesting stuff but there\&#39;s better.&#39;,
 &#34;The scenes are fast-paced. the characters are great. I love Anne-Marie Johnson&#39;s acting. I really like the ending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was disappointed that this movie didn&#39;t delve deeper into Achilles&#39;s and Athena&#39;s relationship. It only blossomed when they kissed each other.&#34;,
 &#34;This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with &#39;American Beauty&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael&#39;s boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael&#39;s wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a way &#39;Road to Perdition&#39; is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.&#34;,
 &#39;This show is so incredibly hilarious that I couldn\&#39;t stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (despite the fact that I\&#39;ve seen all the episodes previously). I\&#39;ve always regarded Silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience. I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time... I can\&#39;t say that about many TV shows... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) funny! This is a show I will never miss and it is one I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to watch this show... I predict a long run for this series... And just to be clear, the people who are offended by this show just don\&#39;t get it... perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it... they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don\&#39;t understand. Anyone who uses the word &#34;bigot&#34; in reference to Silverman, or who claims that she only aims to &#34;shock&#34;... is way off the mark... She\&#39;s exactly the opposite; just Google her and you\&#39;ll quickly see that she\&#39;s a huge proponent of civil rights, etc. If you don\&#39;t know that she\&#39;s ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints, you don\&#39;t get it. And if you don\&#39;t get it, do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity...&#39;,
 &#39;I just finished watching &#34;El Otro&#34;. I have always taken my hat off to Julio Chavez\&#39;s performances, as he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn\&#39;t for Julio. Anyways, this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life, but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely didn\&#39;t like this movie.&#39;,
 &#39;Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944\&#39;s &#34;Laura, re-teamed for this excellent 1950 film-noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can\&#39;t get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn\&#39;t know when to stop using his hands. It\&#39;s this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically decent human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is not exactly upbeat as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally admits to what he has done.&#39;,
 &#39;This film is notable for three reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two \&#39;Superman\&#39; serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking George Reeves\&#39; and Phyllis Coates\&#39; initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is re-used in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the \&#39;hollow Earth\&#39; allowing the \&#39;Mole-Men\&#39; to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. No \&#39;mild mannered reporter\&#39; here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout (&#34;I\&#39;ll handle this!&#34;), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, he is gentler than Clark towards the feisty Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as &#34;Nazi storm troopers.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of Superman in the two serials to the \&#39;live action\&#39; flying in the \&#39;Adventures of Superman\&#39; had not yet been made.&#39;,
 &#34;I LOVED this movie! I am biased seeing as I am a huge Disney fan, but I really enjoyed myself. The action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going! This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they don&#39;t spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out)and there are no musical numbers. It is strictly action adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, be they young or old.&#34;,
 &#39;No matter how well meaning his &#34;message&#34; is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.&#39;,
 &#34;Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storm doesn&#39;t even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn&#39;t anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stalking, likewise doesn&#39;t get intense until almost the end of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill&#39;s problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv&#39;s bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill&#39;s husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought Sean had never been to either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner &amp; manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn&#39;t even say anything to Sean when he arrives home. This made no sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill has given Richard her business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. She shows him a condo. Afterwards they have a drink, and things get cozy between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard and Jill are getting it on, hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course that&#39;s all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but Jill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars&#34;,
 &#39;On MTV cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie Scarface out of their DVD collection. This may give you an idea that Scarface is a &#34;gangster movie&#34;. Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that\&#39;s not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. He falls in with the mob group and becomes a well-known drug lord. Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: &#34;Say hello to my little friend!&#34; is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think about Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate it ***1/2 (out of ****). Definitely a movie you must see. PHENOMENAL.&#39;,
 &#39;This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had won! Basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood quite often embraced Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list and deservedly so. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its\&#39; &#34;31 Days of Oscar&#34; tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and the shot\&#39;s so smooth, the net barely moved. Most solidly and highly recommended!!!&#39;,
 &#39;I started watching the show from the first season, and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. Original movie was kind of childish, and I was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the BSG new season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after few episodes I became a fan. I\&#39;ve loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O\&#39;Neill, the not-only-smart Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal\&#39;c, women and kids favorite, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, stories sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but mostly it\&#39;s not about technology or space fighting - it\&#39;s about helping your friend, even risking your life for him. It\&#39;s about &#34;we don\&#39;t leave anybody behind&#34;. Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will, and all good qualities that makes a human - Human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now it\&#39;s breaking a record, going 10th season, and still doing good.&#39;,
 &#39;After some internet surfing, I found the &#34;Homefront&#34; series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program &#34;Nightline&#34;, complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990\&#39;s. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this show\&#39;s credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a &#34;homefront&#34; either. Curiously, the first episode of the show &#34;Homefront&#34; begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That\&#39;s like shooting the first episode of &#34;Gilligan\&#39;s Island&#34; showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show\&#39;s namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940\&#39;s. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show\&#39;s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil &#34;whites&#34; to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We\&#39;re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for &#34;Homefront&#34;. The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical &#34;frightened / angry black family&#34;. The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 \x96 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.&#39;,
 &#39;True, there are many movies much worse then this movie. This movie was no Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them both.. twice) but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I\&#39;m talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I\&#39;ll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting- I\&#39;ll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film (next to the ending credits, which played \&#39;Wish I had An Angel\&#39;, the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just didn\&#39;t walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well (somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it). Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that\&#39;s all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soundtrack- Except for \&#39;Wish I had An Angel\&#39;, the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story (something I will get to soon). A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Directing- Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us &#34;Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that\&#39;s just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies&#34;. At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Producing- Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I\&#39;m glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud). Then it fast-forwards many years later where he\&#39;s a paranoia detective. He get\&#39;s attacked by some zombie that can\&#39;t be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, the plot is bad, really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, miss out on this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0.&#39;,
 &#34;This is, in my opinion, much better than either of the 2 1990&#39;s versions, but is still not all that good. It feels dated, probably because it is, but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980&#39;s period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90&#39;s versions, and St John Rivers is at least covered, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it.&#34;,
 &#39;I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran, so I didn\&#39;t know who had done it at first. The longer I saw it, the more I started thinking, &#34;Jesus, this looks like an Albert Pyun flick.&#34; Wasn\&#39;t quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good (and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful), and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon, a murderous cyborg, but with some style and a sense of humor. Paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out, because Albert Pyun hasn\&#39;t written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career. Unfortunately, Paulin doesn\&#39;t have all that much screen time before he\&#39;s gone, and the movie\&#39;s the worse for it. Lance Henriksen, playing the evil head cyborg, growls his way through his part, as he\&#39;s done in countless other movies like this. I don\&#39;t know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it. He goes through the movie looking (and sounding) like he just woke up, and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent. Kathy Long, the nominal hero, has a great body, is attractive, has a great body, fights extremely well, has a great body, and doesn\&#39;t have an iota of acting talent, but that doesn\&#39;t matter in a movie like this. This being an Albert Pyun film, it\&#39;s full of the trademarks that we\&#39;ve all come to know and love: inane and idiotic dialog, choppy editing, and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured, &#34;Ah, nobody\&#39;ll ever notice.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As bad as this movie is, however, it\&#39;s a shade above most of Pyun\&#39;s other efforts--this is &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; compared to his brain-numbing &#34;Adrenaline: Feel the Rush&#34;, for example. The fights are pretty well done, if repetitive (after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other, you find yourself saying, &#34;Alright already, go to something else&#34;), and Long is very athletic (and, as a previous poster has noted, has a great derrière). It\&#39;s not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it\&#39;s not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as Pyun\&#39;s usual extravaganzas. You could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse, granted, but worse nonetheless.&#39;,
 &#39;I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of &#34;romance&#34; and &#34;western&#34; with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if you\&#39;re expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It\&#39;s sickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple. It\&#39;s revolting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.&#39;,
 &#39;There\&#39;s hardly anything at all to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act, though her role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre. In a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference. No such luck here. Creature Unknown&#34; a clichéd monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other. The monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of Paul Blaisdell. So bad it\&#39;s good! The rest of the show is just so bad it\&#39;s bad. A little humor might have made this more palatable, but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up. There is a twist or two at the end, but by then you won\&#39;t care anymore.&#39;,
 &#39;Let\&#39;s go straight to the point: this is The Movie I would take with me on a desert island (with dvd player). It\&#39;s just perfect. If a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors, you like to see them free to involve in the space and feelings, this movie is for you. See the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) come on stage drunk and Maurice(Cassavetes) has to improvise because she doesn\&#39;t follow the script anymore. If you\&#39;re sensitive to the camera\&#39;s movements, you\&#39;ll be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, the particular flow, that give you the impression camera follow the actors as if it was lead by the theatrical principle of &#34;private space&#34;... amazing. And the story is just a brilliant mix of tale and realistic drama. Cassavetes is again arguing with Hollywood and the majors\&#39; politics, but this time, he do it through Broadway, making one of the most exciting movie about theater. Well, this movie is a bliss.&#39;,
 &#39;Wow. This movie bored the pants off me when I saw it. Bland, pointless and unmoving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Ash and co. can travel through time with the help of &#34;The Spirit of the Forest&#34; (\&#39;Princess Mononoke\&#39; much??) There, they meet a dorky kid named Sam, and the &#34;plot&#34; begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get high with nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi (the &#34;Spirit&#34;) from some weirdo hunter guy. I don\&#39;t even know what else went on. It all went by in a blur. Ash\&#39;s friends were hardly in it, and all the fight scenes were boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends, must return to their time, while watching Sam float away with Celebi (that scene was just creepy. O-O;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival\&#39;s grandpa. And I think that\&#39;s it. Pretty retarded isn\&#39;t it? If you love your children, you won\&#39;t expose them to this. (1 out of 10.)&#39;,
 &#39;Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character. This film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness. It will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities.&#39;,
 &#34;Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God&#39;s powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey&#39;s facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10&#34;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was messing around on the Trinity board when I saw some user mention how the Wes Craven series is a lot better then the &#39;crap&#39; that&#39;s Blade, So I did my quick research: Checked the scores on IMDb &amp; RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores I was seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#39;s take a quick personal recap here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking it at all, and then seeing the scores of Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I&#39;m the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I went in knowing when I started watching this movie was that it&#39;s low budget, so because of that, I&#39;m going to have to ignore a lot of the v/fx and just figure it&#39;s going to compensated by story &amp; acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder &amp; Jason Scott Lee)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh geez\x85 This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it pretty fricken laughable, the bad audio synch from the re-recording of dialogue in a FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book on it, but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get &#39;infected&#39;? Nope, this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also must&#39;ve blinked at some point, because I&#39;m not sure how &#39;Dracula&#39; got clothes on his body, especially since he&#39;s big wild and angry &amp; I figure if I was in that situation, I wouldn&#39;t want to be the one dressing him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy\x85 it doesn&#39;t, instead it&#39;s a &#39;Cliff Hangar&#39; where I now get to wait for the 3rd installment &#39;Legacy&#39;. Oh the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.&#34;,
 &#34;As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter, as AMC billed it as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with a film! Cary&#39;s usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire movie; he comes across as strained, bored, and just not himself. Mississip&#39;s character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from), and whenever he does deliver a line, it&#39;s several decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable, country-bumpkin goofball, but in the end, he manages only to detract from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability, this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with. Ray Walston&#39;s character was sugary and ultimately contrived. For four men on shore leave, it was the tamest leave I&#39;ve ever seen. I watched this nightmare until its very end, and while I won&#39;t spoil that for anyone, I will tell you that it&#39;s the most absurd you&#39;ll ever see. The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men, but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast. Sorry, Cary!&#34;,
 &#34;This could have been a very good film, if I had been able to watch it. The hand held camera was very bouncy. From the opening credits I was worried. Several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end. But we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film, giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it. The acting seemed very authentic. Some of the dialog was a little hard to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of it funny. If you get motion sickness at all though, you may seriously consider skipping this film. It&#39;s quaint, but not worth the nausea.&#34;,
 &#34;I have to admit, I wasn&#39;t expecting much going into this film viewing in my Japenese film class, but this film really blew me away. The director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind. This film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs. American, in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising the imagination very little.&#34;,
 &#39;If you hit your head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that hasn\&#39;t been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better. Those who think &#34;Scarface&#34; was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw &#34;Goodfellas&#34;, &#34;Menace II Society&#34; or &#34;Dead Presidents&#34; and thought MMM &#34;That\&#39;s the life for me!&#34; will like this movie. I thought I\&#39;d give the movie a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone above a 4th grade education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.&#39;,
 &#39;Rented it last night. The opening(2001) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose. Some skits were just retarded. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total: 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me give you some advice: If you want a crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent &#34;Kentucky Fried Movie&#34;. If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent &#34;AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON&#34; or &#34;UHF&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, don\&#39;t bother renting this movie. You\&#39;ll save 2-3 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO: Ken Shapiro\&#39;s best movie is STILL &#34;Modern Problems&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;I went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was. It was a combination of every horror/thriller cliché, trying to comment on many things including pedophilia, Satan worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion... and it was a mess. the acting was pretty washboard; the kid and the Jesus dude were alright, but apart from them.... Anyways. I admire the effort (though slightly failed) on the attempt at showing the Christian people in a different way...even though they did that, the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish. But then again, it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid... no. actually, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s just all around bad. music... oh my gosh... horrible... toooo over-dramatic. Okay. I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier; It seemed like a poor student project. I&#39;m going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap. there you go.&#34;,
 &#34;I only rented this because i loved the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it. He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tragic storyline, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time. It&#39;s not even comically bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we end up with is a dull, uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichéd acting. It just reeks of low budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid like the Bubonic plague.&#34;,
 &#34;I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn&#39;t have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.&#34;,
 &#39;Leonard Maltin must\&#39;ve been watching some other movie. (Though I find his Guide to be quite a valuable resource, please disregard his comments on this one.) He states &#34;starts off well then fizzles&#34; when it\&#39;s really the reverse - &#34;starts off tepid then catches fire&#34;. The plot is about as simple as it gets. Happy Mom, Happy Dad and Happy Son take a vacation at an isolated beach, Dad incapacitated in accident, Mom runs off to get help, meets up with dangerous escaped convict. Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good white-knuckler given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker, appearing suddenly (the director, John Sturges, films it in a clever way that will make you gasp) around halfway through as the cunning, desperate criminal. Meeker is an unusually flippant, reckless actor (at least here and in the classic &#34;Kiss Me Deadly&#34;) and he happily snatches the keys to the film\&#39;s narrative and speeds off with the top down. His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying &#34;Pretty neat, huh?&#34; when he\&#39;s especially pleased with his misdeeds. There is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, &#34;Don\&#39;t go away&#34;. She fires back &#34;Where would I go?&#34; (they\&#39;re in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes sitcom-ishly &#34;Yeah, that\&#39;s right&#34;. The friction between them is a hoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are flaws, somewhat ridiculous ones. There\&#39;s one scene where the police, who have been chasing after Meeker for some time, stop Stanwyck\&#39;s car and to evade detection Meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would, and pretends to be asleep as she\&#39;s being questioned. A. He looks conspicuously un-masculine in this pose and B. I think it\&#39;s safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#34;Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, stick in a few bad guys, have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the flimsiest of plots, then work out a happy ending for everybody (other than the three or four who get murdered, of course) That&#39;s the classic (and successful) format of the Harlequin Romance. It&#39;s not very good but then it&#39;s not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books. And the location stuff in Budapest is especially interesting, even if they didn&#39;t use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the city&#39;s famous thermal baths.&#34;,
 &#39;I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD. The acting throughout is excellent - no question. There was not quite enough action for me I must say. No real suspense as such, just plenty of first class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of &#34;whodunnit&#34;. If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you. Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film portrayed the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things. As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time &amp; time again as a crook and a con man. Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally damaged by his father\&#39;s influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away. He has no real love or loyalty in him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series. Very well done though.&#39;,
 &#34;`Stanley and Iris&#39; is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. Stanley&#39;s life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today&#39;s films. A good film all round. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;They were always trying to get me killed,&#34; Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit\&#39;s technicians. &#34;They thought actors got in the way of things.&#34; He went on to describe how he\&#39;d been given a wire rope to climb down and, assured it was safe, narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;People get in the way of things&#34; might be a maxim tailor-made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton (fittingly played blank slate-fashion by Alec Guinness) in Alexander Mackendrick\&#39;s definitive Ealing film of 1951. Certainly, he cares only about his work, its realisation - and sod the consequences. And similarly, with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters, there\&#39;s almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in flashback, the film concerns Stratton\&#39;s invention of a dirt-resistant, everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title), and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market, the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job. Abduction and bribery attempts follow, with both money and an industry chief\&#39;s daughter on offer (Daphne, the delectable, 4-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood), to the tragi-comic end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;What\&#39;s to become of my bit of washing when there\&#39;s no washing to do?&#34; bemoans Stratton\&#39;s landlady near the close. A notion Stratton hadn\&#39;t even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie\&#39;s ambiguous coda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superior, if decidedly downbeat comedy, expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water...&#39;,
 &#39;We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made. However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L\&#39;Engle\&#39;s fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Mind you, I\&#39;m not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into this affair with an open mind. I figured that a made-for-T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. After all, the Star Wars spin-off Ewoks was decent, if a little silly. Come to think of it, the original Star Wars was made on &#34;a lunch money budget&#34;, and look where it took George Lucas! However, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if I\&#39;d gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic), Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. That\&#39;s right, a crow. Moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man, half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting, and the story. I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua. In the film, she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever. In fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her. Calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become\x85a jock! The irony is horrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is &#34;above gender&#34; and likes to look at &#34;funny&#34; things, such as girls falling off of swings. The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed &#34;the Dude With Red Eyes&#34; due to his complete reinvention as a character).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which didn\&#39;t do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work. Here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flat-nosed wookies of Ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earth-like Camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sorry that this film exists. I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. It\&#39;s the way the characters are written that ruins it. A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic, scored by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people. Even Madeleine L\&#39;Engle thought it was bad. The book was Good, the film was Bad, and Mrs. Whatsit was Ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score: 0.1/10 (If I could) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They got the names right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation, script, acting and special effects, not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book. Oh, and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn\&#39;t even bother to Photoshop Meg\&#39;s arm on properly.&#39;,
 &#39;This is Paul F. Ryan\&#39;s first and only full-length feature. He hasn\&#39;t done anything since. However, he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story. I don\&#39;t know when or why the idea emerged in his head, but Ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie, &#34;Home room&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Busy Philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as Alicia, a troubled girl; the ones we always see in television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a package of cigarettes in the pocket, weird look and disturbing eyes (with makeup, of course). An event has occurred at her school; a shooting. Some students have died, and she saw everything. Now Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case, and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But the shooting is just the genesis; the movie is not about the shooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lying in bed in a hospital room is Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen). She is one of the survivors of the hospital. The script establishes a bond between them, by the school Principal (James Pickens Jr). He is helping all the students to recover from the event, but Alicia doesn\&#39;t seem to care. She\&#39;s isolated. So the Principal punishes her; she needs to visit Deanna every day until five o\&#39; clock. Then the movie starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t even describe how wonderfully written I think the movie is. I can identify with the characters and the situations they live; I like reality. These things could happen to anyone. And the things they say are totally understandable. They\&#39;re growing up and trying to deal with things they haven\&#39;t experienced; they\&#39;re doing their best. Without knowing it, Alicia (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director leads Christensen and Philipps through their roles very well. Look the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts; no complexity inside of her mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks: &#34;Who has brought them?&#34;. &#34;Many people&#34;, Deanna answers; although some days later we learn they\&#39;re from her parents, who come every week. The parental figures are all well represented, but are not as important as their sons\&#39; characters. Deanna is lonely. Alicia seems mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking roughly. But after two days of visiting, she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day; even sleeping in Deanna\&#39;s room all night. When they both have a fight afterwards, I believe Deanna says: &#34;Why do you keep coming back?&#34;. Alicia is lonely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending of the movie, without ruining it, comes a bit disappointing; it\&#39;s something I wasn\&#39;t waiting for. It eliminates some of the strength the movie has. The revelation comes totally unnecessary; ruining the logical climax the movie could have had. It was an excellent script anyway; and an excellent direction. A damn fine movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Erika Christensen, this was the role she needed to fly higher. Her role in &#34;Traffic&#34; was impressing, but this was the big step; the main role. Maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film, and that\&#39;s a pity. She hasn\&#39;t made one false move since then. She has even come out with good performances in awful movies. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who proved to be very promising in this movie (what a transformation), hasn\&#39;t got many opportunities for other roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same I say about Paul F. Ryan (in directing, of curse), and I expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script; I\&#39;m waiting for his next movie. I\&#39;m hoping the best for all of them.&#39;,
 &#39;This is one of my all-time favorite films, and while it may move too slowly for some, it\&#39;s well worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving &#34;city&#34; Aborigines, and this is no ordinary case. OK, a man has died but it wasn\&#39;t exactly a normal killing. There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately, and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic &amp; oppressive. The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans. This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about &#34;City&#34; vs. &#34;Tribal&#34; Aborigines, and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. Uh huh. Chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what\&#39;s happening, although no matter how many times I\&#39;ve seen this I can\&#39;t quite grasp the exact connection. This is a very eerie and creepy film, and is a fine example of Peter Weir\&#39;s ability to create tension out of nothing. The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally, it\&#39;s the easiest way out and the scariest. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.&#39;,
 &#34;I previously thought that this film was the lamest of the Muppet films. I would like now to retract that statement. In my opinion now, the lamest MUppet film was the TV movie IT&#39;S A VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, am IT&#39;S A WONDERFUL LIFE rip off that was truly dreadful. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best songs are that &#39;You Can&#39;t Take No For An Answer&#39; song, the one the Muppet Babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I&#39;m told that it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line &#39;What better way could anything end?&#39;. But I wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. I must state though that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three defininitive MUppet movies.&#34;,

 &#34;This is a nice little movie with a nice story, that plays the most important role in the entire movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a quite intriguing dramatic story, with also romance present in it. The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. Normally I&#39;m not a too big fan of the Asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies, produced in the west. In a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. For a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences. This was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oh well, this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it. In that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#34;,
 &#34;....this mini does not get better with age. I saw this and it&#39;s sequel when originally broadcast, and like so many others was blown away. In early 2002 I borrowed the novels for both WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. I then decided that I had to see both again and invested $200 plus on the DVD sets. I watched both minis again in painful detail and realized I had done things backwards - I should have purchased the novels and borrowed the DVD&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t believe it is abysmally miscast? Read the novels and see for yourself. Don&#39;t think this is dated? Screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get (warning - reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes!! Production quality, music scoring, dialog - a great story was turned into a late 70&#39;s soap opera by an overly ambitious producer/director who was in way over his head. This thing was dated the minute it was completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then, tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. IMO - this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints.&#34;,
 &#39;This is one of those horror flicks where twenty-somethings fool around with the dark arts around a camp fire, getting into a heap of trouble for doing so. A portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the Kelippoth of the Sitra Achra by a man whose daughter, Summer, gets kidnapped by something, taken into it. Summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters. This is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny. Anyway, three wannabee witches, who went to high school together, Renea, the most enthusiastic, serious practitioner in the dark arts, and her lesbian cohorts, Jasmine and Marlene(..it\&#39;s more or less a passing fad with them, though..) join up with buddies, Jason and Ricky, on a trip in the wilderness where Summer vanished from her home ten years ago. Opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book, a demon is set free, as is Summer, now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low budget contains a loopy, but ambitious story, restraining it into a confined setting. These young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast. As can be the case in these movies, the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as Summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass, while befriending Jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time. The action is shot mostly in the dark, making any violence hard to decipher. Brigitte Kingsley(and the rest of the female cast for that matter), is some mighty nice eye candy, dressed scantily clad as a female Conan, a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie. Some lesbianism(..some kissing and fondling)and nudity spice things up nicely, and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot..it\&#39;s so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be of interest for co-starring World Wrestling Entertainment\&#39;s &#34;Captain Courageous&#34; Christian(real name, Jason Reso)as one of the group, spoofing his alter ego, as a chicken, quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig. Landy Cannon is likable as unlikely hero, Jason, a lovestruck, naive young man whose ex-fiancé, Jasmine(Vanessa James)is now bi-sexual and in love with Marlene(..Jasmine\&#39;s cruelty is in toying with Jason\&#39;s feelings by hiding her affair with Marlene from his knowledge), while Ricky and Renea attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can rekindle a dead flame that gone out, never to ignite again. The Kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit, I guess to refrain from showing how ludicrous/laughable it looks if presented in full. The lesbian antics of Jasmine and Marlene(Haley Shannon) is mostly tame, their love making, once alone in the woods up against a tree, is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night. My rating is a bit favorable towards it, almost solely because of Kingsley, for purely superficial reasons, rather than the plot or film-making. The movie aims to please and is marketed to the boys(and girls who love hot women). I think, though, for the most part, the humor falls a bit flat.&#39;,
 &#39;How wonderful. Yet another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times, a day a piece, and believes himself to be an &#34;expert&#34; on the country. Sheesh. I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the &#34;land of Nazis&#34; or some such. Wim IL boy, you should get together with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans. Of course we all know it takes a pretentious left-leaning &#34;we are the world&#34; European to make a &#34;real&#34; movie about America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, right. For a continent that started not one but TWO world wars, Europe sure has a lot of opinions about America\&#39;s wrong &#34;foreign policy&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don\&#39;t worry, Wim IL boy, there\&#39;s plenty of UC-Berkeley Americans that\&#39;ll just love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who thinks George W. Bush is worst than Hitler, and that a painting of a can of soup is &#34;sheer genius&#34;!!&#39;,
 &#34;Bonjour Tristesse covers similar ground as &#39;The Member of the Wedding.&#39; to wit, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper. While critics love &#39;Member of the Wedding,&#39; I find Julie Harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she&#39;s been in. This portrays irritating, rich idiots as in Last Year at Marienbad, but this time it&#39;s a travelogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this Preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not. For the first 30 minutes he&#39;s content to blur the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can&#39;t deliver the depth the part requires. Kerr pulls rank and turns the film into &#39;Endless Love.&#39; Seberg&#39;s vacuous narration, is like something out of Strange Interlude - it is not good. I really wish someone other than Niven was in his role. He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a harbor. Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, &#39;The Conformist.&#39; Kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain (as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven Knows Mr. Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc. etc.). Really, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash, or even better, start with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.&#34;,
 &#39;My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone\&#39;s jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew what Christy\&#39;s family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can\&#39;t utter a word, and she can\&#39;t use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I\&#39;VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is seriously underrated, and it shouldn\&#39;t. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can\&#39;t write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you\&#39;re not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn\&#39;t even stand up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point: Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so they\&#39;ll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they don\&#39;t stare at them like they\&#39;re aliens. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem &#34;normal&#34; are people too. 10/10&#39;,
 &#34;Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary&#39;s Baby)creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film: An aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. It has a 60&#39;s cinematic look and it even reminded me of Polanski&#39;s Rosemary&#39;s Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. Furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career- she has no children, doesn&#39;t do charitable deeds, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart. She&#39;s in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the character&#39;s tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. She is a terrific actress and this 70&#39;s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. It&#39;s a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70&#39;s generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70&#39;s which was itself cynical in many aspects- Nixon&#39;s deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, it&#39;s a very haunting film with haunting moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie was pretty absurd. There was a FEW funny parts. Its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where I think, &#34;Hmm.....that movie had a few funny parts, but overall, pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of).&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it seemed like Ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy. And I didn\&#39;t understand how he was a self made multi-millionaire and still such an idiot. Anyways, I like Ben Affleck. He makes some crap, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I didn\&#39;t think Gigli was all his fault, I like him overall. I guess he\&#39;s kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can\&#39;t seem to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to avoid this flick. It didn\&#39;t really develop in to a workable plot and Catherine O\&#39;hara and Jimmy G. weren\&#39;t used as well as they could have been. They deserved better. Overall, this movie is NOT Home Alone, it\&#39;s NOT A Christmas Story, its NOT Christmas Vacation or any of the other classics. Forever Forgettable.&#39;,
 &#39;This piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the Native American Indians played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971 Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from &#34;The Jimmy Stewart Show&#34; (a short-lived series that mercifully flopped) just because Williams was black. As if that were not bad enough, this film is very dated and boring. Watch &#34;Dances with Wolves&#34; instead for a less racist view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made, and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after 16-year-old Debra Paget. I\&#39;m surprised it was even allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/10.&#39;,
 &#39;Although the movie is clearly dated, audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless Buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale. Buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages: the Stone Age, The Roman Age, and the Moden Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different &#34;ages&#34;. In this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the &#34;caveman&#34; stereotype, who wins his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial combat, two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as Mel Brooks\&#39; &#34;History of the World: Part I&#34;. The underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing: Although the times may have-a-changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to &#34;win the girl&#34; (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie\&#39;s &#34;modern times&#34; to now.&#39;,
 &#39;Lynn Hollister, a small-town lawyer, travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend Johnny. (Yes, Lynn is a man despite the feminine-sounding Christian name. Were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that John Wayne\&#39;s birth name was &#34;Marion&#34;?) Hollister at first believes Johnny\&#39;s death to have been an accident, but soon realises that Johnny was murdered. Further investigations reveal a web of corruption, criminality and election rigging connected to Boss Cameron, the leading light in city \&#39;s political machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller, possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941. It isn\&#39;t. &#34;A Man Betrayed&#34;, despite its theme, is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama. Hollister falls in love with Cameron\&#39;s attractive daughter Sabra, and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama. One reviewer states that John Wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer, but he couldn\&#39;t play a cowboy in every movie, and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass. Where I do agree with that reviewer is when he says that Wayne was no Cary Grant impersonator. Romantic comedy just wasn\&#39;t up his street. One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them, regardless of whether it was up their street or not, and as Wayne was one of the few major stars working for Republic Pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, not even Cary Grant himself could have made &#34;A Man Betrayed&#34; work as a comedy. That\&#39;s not a reflection on his comic talents; it\&#39;s a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film. I doubt if anyone, no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be, could find anything to laugh at in it. The film\&#39;s light-hearted tone doesn\&#39;t make it a successful comedy; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else. This is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. 3/10&#39;,
 &#39;This movie looked good - good cast, evergreen topic and an explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why was it filmed by hand held camera? It shakes, judders, part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A poor choice indeed. As if this was not enough, the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all. And then it commits the worst sin of all. After leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending? Doh! This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort by writer and director.&#39;,
 &#39;I bought a DVD of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special about it. The special effects are phoney looking, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a Virgin Mary statue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the &#34;plot&#34; scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you I have no clue what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $5.&#39;,
 &#34;If I write a review about a movie, maybe it will stick with me... but generally I expect that I will have forgotten I&#39;ve seen this one a mere two weeks from now. So why bother? Because again I find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. I didn&#39;t expect I&#39;d to be able to stay in the room while it was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#39;t great, but at least it was not unbearable... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe. It was just sweet fluff... and if you can&#39;t take it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic, and won&#39;t be a total bore to an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It offers a few good chuckles here and there, but nary a side splitter. Sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining, but at least it doesn&#39;t suck (as so many have said it does). Maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to grade on the bell curve, so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book. Giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing. Giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. I cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff (or that I am even bothering to write about it). Am I missing something? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due. You might also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, though his role is ancillary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely you can miss this one if you are an adult. But, if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her... and be prepared NOT to hate it (you might even enjoy it).&#34;,
 &#34;This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when i first read the casting. I probably could have written a more exciting plot, it&#39;s a pity that they left it to a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living. He can&#39;t play, he can&#39;t talk, he can&#39;t even move very good on mainland without his skis... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that&#39;s all. She obviously wasn&#39;t chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs. Nevertheless I must admit that she could be the Tomba&#39;s acting teacher, because he&#39;s even a worse actor than her, and that&#39;s funny, especially considering that she isn&#39;t italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie feels like a film project. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. Despite this amateurish feel, the movie is effective. It&#39;s like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some predictable but well done conflict. Probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his Romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. A good watch but nothing stirring....&#34;,
 &#39;This movie\&#39;s origins are a mystery to me, as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it. I assume that before &#34;Starship Troopers&#34;, &#34;Killshot&#34; was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise. The new title of &#34;Kill Shot&#34; is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. The quick cuts, cheesy &#34;Melrose Place&#34; music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you\&#39;re in for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don\&#39;t mind at all. I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that\&#39;s another review). After looking it up on IMDB, my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted R-rated status - coveted in suspense Video Rental sections, that is. In any event, they should have left it unrated if you\&#39;re trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it\&#39;s entertaining. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you it\&#39;s a TV pilot, though. That was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a TV show, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it\&#39;s better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. Token black guy (who\&#39;s gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating), token Asian (Japanese, I assume from the name Koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family\&#39;s bank account - this show probably would have done ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a movie it just cracks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening, and that\&#39;s all I ask of rentals.&#39;,
 &#34;This is, without a doubt, the single worst movie ever created. There&#39;s no arguing here. This is it. End of story. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, looking like it was created by a three-year-old fascinated with dinosaurs. The entire concept is just plain dumb. It&#39;s inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you haven&#39;t seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is, please don&#39;t make me describe it. Words can&#39;t express how completely awful this movie is. This isn&#39;t just bad as in being a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000, and you still haven&#39;t come close to how awful this movie is. After giving Pokemon the Movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. That&#39;s how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund. And don&#39;t even think about renting it again.&#34;,
 &#39;really awful... lead actor did OK... the film, plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well... anything it had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way... and should be avoided like the plague by any Carlito\&#39;s ways fans... no mention of Gail in fact he ends up with some other bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail... they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning... but to be honest when rating it I was looking for a zero mark... unfortunately I had to rate it higher...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90\&#39;s... overall it was approximately £6 and 2 hours of my life wasted... for all the &#34;action&#34; in it, it was truly boring slow and predictable... again to any Carltio\&#39;s Way fans avoid this fiasco...&#39;,
 &#34;As much as I like Japanese movies this one didn&#39;t just cut it... A movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography is OK, though I&#39;ve seen much better sword fight scenes in other Japanese movies, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn&#39;t convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak you don&#39;t even notice its presence.But worst of all was the way the plot evolved.I have to admit that, at some times, I had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on...Anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if your looking for an action Japanese movie this isn&#39;t it. Its very slow, with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental... in a bad way...&#34;,
 &#39;i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of T.R. took me on to the journey - well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning, but the absurd humor it and the gordious looks of both sissy actors - i do not know who played the young her - but she was great and so was uma!!! -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour, i was with a friend - and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends - and, we both enjoyed it too the maximum - hilarious laughs - sadness about the &#34;realistic police- normalos&#34; . both of us fans of T.Robbins books...i found it well done - thought, that Robbins would also approve, though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would love to see the cut out stuff - i heard that gus v. sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first-time viewers (or the producers???) well still it is an artistic movie. much too short though... it is one of my all time favorites - and i am aware of it that the majority of people can\&#39;t stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think .......what a pity. hopefully there will come the day that there will be a DVD with the full material - hoping to see more of crispian, keanu - expecting to see her baby and all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have the chance to see it, think twice, and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch ... m&#39;,
 &#39;What I think I\&#39;ll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, &#34;Phantom Menace&#34;, is that it will likely blow &#34;Titanic&#34; out of the water, if you\&#39;ll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare &#34;Titanic&#34; is the greatest film they\&#39;ve ever seen, I think to myself, &#34;You don\&#39;t see a lot of movies, do you?&#34; What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than &#34;Titanic&#34;, and for the same price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,&#34; as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald\&#39;s, but that doesn\&#39;t mean it\&#39;s high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn\&#39;t live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It\&#39;s true, &#34;Phantom Menace&#34; will likely suffer a similar fate. but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Cameron\&#39;s &#34;Titanic&#34; is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it\&#39;s finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which I would\&#39;ve enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn\&#39;t seen it yet, I say, &#34;I wish I could trade places with you.&#34; g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn\&#39;t recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who\&#39;ll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic\&#39;s story, acting or length.&#39;,
 &#39;Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I have read both of his books and think that he is great. Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story about a family really getting to know each other. Through a road trip a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midts of a family crisis. They do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life...they are just doing them much later in life. The situations are very funny, but have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life (not obsurdly over the top or cartoonish). This is the first time that I watch Paul Reiser and fully believed every emotion that was portrayed. At times, his eyes look so sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gret movie and great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion but an uplifting message...Olympia Dukakas does a great job also :)&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;What happens when you give a homeless man $100,000?&#34; As if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen. The creators of &#34;Reversal of Fortune&#34; try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $100,000 to see if he will turn his life around. Then, with only the most cursory guidance and counseling, they let him go on his merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are they trying to say? &#34;Money can\&#39;t buy you happiness?&#34; &#34;The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?&#34; Or how about, &#34;Lift a man up - it\&#39;s more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude.&#34; They took a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watched him dump it all down the drain. That\&#39;s supposed to be entertainment? They dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos - only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked, &#34;What happens when you take down a stop sign?&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Being a fan of silent films, I looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long, commercial for the Maxwell automobile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is, I may have enjoyed the film more. But it got old very fast. And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without lessening a viewer&#39;s enjoyment, what was with the Mexican bandits? I mean, they are chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour, yet they can&#39;t catch up to it?&#34;,
 &#34;Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, has no problems in creating passionate subject matter. Panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing, non-professional cast. While still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country, he does so without the need of a heavy storyline. It is a positive take on a country, in particular its people, that the Iranian population desperately need. The greatest pity is it won&#39;t be released domestically. The insular, paranoid Iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up amid revolution and watching the academics, artists and educated &#39;disappear&#39; over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there. The realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event. The fact he shot it on 35mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence in only using non-professional actors also really works in this film. Fine performances all round. After watching many films showing the problems Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government. This film does the opposite. It shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn&#39;t too far away. Some call Panahi a feminist film maker but I think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran. Young, independent women.&#34;,
 &#34;People like me will tear this movie apart. It&#39;s just not realistic. The Plot is sooooooo predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens convientantly Of course, they find the treasure and become filthy rich, and trick the bad guy. We&#39;ve seen it a million times before. The writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid. They must be right because The majority of people actually liked this film. I mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds. The secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway? You&#39;d think with all the work that&#39;s gone on in New York underground That room would have been discovered before. and all that was constructed during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail?? how cute, and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler novels was weak. They just fall in love like that, in 2 seconds WHATEVER I&#39;d be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some. the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Garbage&#34;,
 &#39;Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.&#39;,
 &#39;When I first heard about the show, I heard a lot about it, and it was getting some good reviews. I watched the first episode of this &#34;forensic fairy tale&#34;, as it so proclaims itself, and I really got hooked on it. I have loved it since. This show has a good sense of humour and it\&#39;s fun to see a good show like this. The cast is excellent as their characters, and I wouldn\&#39;t want to change them in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar with this show, Pushing Daisies centers around a man named Ned (aka The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace) who discovered a special gift when he was a boy: He could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger. He first did so with his dog, Digby. However, there is the catch: If he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute, someone else dies. He learned this when he brought his mother back to life, and his childhood crush\&#39;s father died in Ned\&#39;s mother\&#39;s place. The other catch is if he touches the person again, they\&#39;re dead again, but this time for good. He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight. His father took him to boarding school, and when he left, Ned never saw his father again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost 20 years later, Ned owns a pie bakery, cleverly titled &#34;The Pie Hole.&#34; A co-worker of Ned\&#39;s, Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) has a crush on Ned, but Ned rejects her moves, trying not to get close to anyone, learning from past experiences. Private Investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) discovered the gift that Ned has, and decides to make him a partner in solving murders. Ned touches the victim, asks who killed them, and when the minute is up, he touches them again, and they solve it. That\&#39;s how they usually solve it. Throughout the episodes, the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, Ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart, Charlotte &#34;Chuck&#34; Charles (Anna Friel). He brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive. In her place, the funeral director, who stole jewelery from the corpses, died. When Emerson finds out, and when Chuck wants to help with solving the murders, he doesn\&#39;t agree a bit--for a while, we hear him call Chuck \&#39;Dead girl\&#39;. This is all kept in secret from Olive, Chuck\&#39;s aunts Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz, respectively), and everyone else for that matter, in case anyone recognized her from obituaries, the news, etc. Vivian and Lily, formerly synchronized swimmers, hadn\&#39;t left the house in years. Emerson, Ned, and Chuck agree to work together. Ned and Chuck grow to love each other, though they can\&#39;t touch each other ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is funny, has terrific characters, contains great plot twists, and will definitely get your spirits up. I hope it doesn\&#39;t get cancelled at 13 episodes.&#39;,
 &#39;This Movie was amazing, it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director/ writer. Sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good Cheadle did a great job too. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the Writing and directing of the film. This film focuses on the real Americans, the past generation, no stereotypes or Racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and coping. Instead of picking on Psychiatry, it defines it, not as someone who heals you magically, but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you, but rather will guide you though your thoughts. This movie is all round amazing!&#39;,
 &#39;THHE remake was a superior movie remake in every way. Most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of Alexandre Aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub-genre of horror is concerned. In steps part 2 directed by another individual Martin Weisz and written by the father and son combo of Jonathan and Wes &#34;I cannot make a good horror movie to save my life anymore&#34; Craven and if this is any indication of Weisz directing skills and young Craven\&#39;s writing skills we are all in for a painful future as THHE 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on ANY level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come, only hint to what could have been in this film. We then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects. In steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day, this is where the major problems begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From very sub par acting (yes even for this kind of movie) to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time THHE 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves. Think the Marines in Aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained. This is the true shame of the film as most of the Hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see, like in the first film, in fact if this did not have THHE 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a Sci-Fi Channel original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mutant Mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting. Also the one that took the cake was the Sloth-like Mutant (you know Sloth from the Goonies) who helps them out in the 3rd act. I was waiting for him to ask for a Baby Ruth or start going on about Rocky Road Ice Cream. Truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really isn\&#39;t anything that stood out like in the first. Another major strike against this movie. So what did work here, the answer is nothing at all. This felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually &#34;good&#34; film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go on about the crappy Drill SGT., the radio man that has a speech impediment (that\&#39;s right, he is the kind of guy I want radioing in for help in a real crisis) or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our &#34;hero&#34; in the first film but I believe you get the point. This movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first. It should have been given another title and been added to the Saturday Night Line up on The Sci-Fi Channel. A true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as I give THHE 2 the same score as its part: 2/10 Dreadful: Words cannot describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way, uninspired and down-right unnecessary. Next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad...don\&#39;t even bother. Please don\&#39;t go support this garbage at the theaters, save your money and thank me later!!!!&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;ll say it again: this movie was totally lame. Kids will like it, sure, but adults...doubtful. The whole thing was basically a rehash of the original, which is to be expected, since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie, but still, did they have to completely rehash the entire movie? I mean, everything is re-done from the Little Mermaid. The worst part of it is Morgana &#34;Ursula\&#39;s crazy sister&#34; who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his magic trident. Why didn\&#39;t Triton do anything about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I could go on, but I won\&#39;t. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the Little Mermaid, and was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell. Overall it is a terrible waste of time.&#39;,
 &#39;I had fun watching this movie, mainly due to Simon Pegg, who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is hired from his dead end London publishing job by big shot NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrity rags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After paying his dues, he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom (the &#34;seventh room&#34;), where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself. The storyline is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formulaic plot aside, the movie was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. The rest of the supporting cast did its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good comedy &amp; well worth checking out at the theaters.&#39;,
 &#39;I saw this movie, and the play, and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen. Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive, And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing. This simply surpass a five star, I rate it a ten. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, Please notify me ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance.&#39;,
 &#34;I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: The story (or actually the lack there of) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term &#39;bad performance&#39;. Bad acting wouldn&#39;t have been such a huge problem if only &#39;director&#39; Bilal didn&#39;t take himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic, it looks like Bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here. Well, there&#39;s no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, only pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in &#39;Van Helsing&#39; look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, it is quite a problem that the CGI-effects look so fake. If the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilal&#39;s a dead guy, since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie.&#34;,
 &#39;I loved this movie. It is a definite inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rental or worth buying. It should be in everyones home. Best movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It is a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in. I love a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it is as long as it is. I get so engrossed in it, that it goes so quick. I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can.&#39;,
 &#39;First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. In this film, you will not see a single sailing boat. You will not see sailors, ghosts, or anything remotely exciting. It is not the story of the ghost ship, and I wish they had notified it in the main credits or I wouldn\&#39;t have watched it, because I really thought it was the film about the legend. It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship, since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the &#34;Flying Dutchman&#34; legend... I don\&#39;t understand why. It is maybe based on the resembling legend called &#34;The Wandering Jew&#34;? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. Unfortunately, it is the only battle scene of the film. Then you see Daniel Emilfork (who was Krank in City of Lost Children) for about two seconds, and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting. Unfortunately he is very bad in the film. The same thing can be said about Italian actor Nino Manfredi, who was one of Italia\&#39;s best actors ever, and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the &#34;wise man&#34; of the film. And boy, does that film need wiseness! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement, yelling, torturing others (in excrement), fornicating (in excrement) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it. It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another. Coming from a Dutch director, you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece, elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven\&#39;s film, &#34;Flesh + Blood&#34;, such a great film. The thought of &#34;Flesh + Blood&#34; would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good. Unfortunately, and unlike &#34;Flesh + Blood&#34;, there is no dramatic progression, no fights, no good acting, and put simply, no &#34;Flesh and Blood&#34;. The photography, as the opening sequence unfolds, is well-done and enticing. This too, stops very early in the film. The music, from Nicola Piovani (of &#34;La vità e bella&#34; fame) is repetitive and annoying, when not irrelevant (it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence, while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung). Throughout the first &#34;act&#34; of the film, which lasts nothing less than an hour (!), the film takes place within the same perimeter, which is around the farm where the main characters live. The characters play with excrement a lot, drown in it, play in it. A long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character, a young boy who loves to play in excrement, to become older and play in excrement some more. The bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian. Spanish conquistadors speak French. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confused and takes hours to happen. Then there is a second act called &#34;the Ship&#34;, in which we see what might have been a ship, a long time ago, but which is now remains of a ship (covered with excrement did I mention?). The main character, while walking a bit further away from the farm, just happens to run into it, and decides it\&#39;s really cool so let\&#39;s live in it. The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him, but he doesn\&#39;t really mind because (did I mention?) he\&#39;s not very bright. He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it, until more conquistadors show up (at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I\&#39;ve said it\&#39;s really confused who\&#39;s who), make the Dutchman a prisoner, along with the retarded hunchback, and they burn the ship to the ground. The last part of the film, which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it, takes place in a mad asylum. Yet more torture and drowning each other with feces. Yet more loitering for the director, who seems to have definitely given up on his job, or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. In the end, a lot of the mentally-challenged new &#34;friends&#34; that the Dutchman made die. The woman he had sex with who was his brother\&#39;s wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son. The Dutchman and his son talk. The film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances. Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends, while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don\&#39;t have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses.&#39;,
 &#39;Let me be really clear about this movie. I didn\&#39;t watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for the saucy sex scenes. That being said, this movie is so god damn awful I flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie already had me cringing.. you see a woman painting something by the lakeside, in pure bliss and serene, then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her. When they both finished, they show each other what they had done... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN SHE IS FACING INFRONT OF THE LAKE. What kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake?? And in another scene, Traci gets to kill her teacher\&#39;s lover by smash him with the sail pole, and then she swims away, and none of the town\&#39;s police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE DID SHE? HER FINGER PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE GOD DAMN BOAT!! After that, it gets worst, whenever Mandy is around, there is the &#34;chilling&#34; sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit. It\&#39;s also a real pity Rosanna Arquette\&#39;s is in this movie. I feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. Same goes for Jürgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to star in this movie. All in all, 2/10.&#39;,
 &#34;This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world&#39;s population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet&#39;s radiation. People&#39;s clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more...and they&#39;re supposed to look stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet&#39;s radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equally insulting is the 60&#39;s horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80&#39;s hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don&#39;t see this movie, ever.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can&#39;t believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway I loved the first Major League, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series. You can&#39;t tell me this wasn&#39;t the plan after the second film was completed. What Happened? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don&#39;t watch this junk.&#34;,
 &#34;After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first ever so bare with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest (with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me.) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I wasn&#39;t particularly thrilled either! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing, after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality. As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in. Until she adds her constantly away father to the house, due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab!&#34;,
 &#34;I thought it was an extremely clever film. I was very pleased with it and truly couldn&#39;t&#39; ask for more. I actually own the film because I didn&#39;t return it to someone... Which I should do, but I really want to keep it due to how much I enjoyed it. Also, the fact I don&#39;t own too many foreign films and this is a first. Now, I personally love Finnish stuff so, that definitely added to how much I enjoyed it. But overall, its worth watching. However, if you&#39;re not into the whole trying to understand Finnish or read Subtitles bit, then this film is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10 for sure.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back.&#34; Supposedly, &#34;Keep the River On your Right&#34; is &#34;a modern cannibal tale&#34;. In reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of New Ginuea, mostly touting the native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but really that\&#39;s about it. Unless of course, you are interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really &#34;a modern cannibal tale.&#34; - MERK&#39;,
 &#39;It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship.&#39;,
 &#39;SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by &#34;front loading&#34; some Voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it\&#39;s all moot.) I did like how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having Janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew(s) pulled it off.&#39;,
 &#39;Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of Titanic was more surprising when compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I only like Will Smith when is in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying &#34;Aw Hell Nah&#34; as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an Oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I wasn\&#39;t looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated. There are flashes of comedy but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated Will Smith performance I have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast were all grand too - Rosario Dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine as where all the other bit players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a weepy - but it isn\&#39;t throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. You will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and comes of all the better for it.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, i can and will be very short. This is a wrong-balanced, non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better. The script seems to not know which way to go ... from funny to cliche-wise serious... it\&#39;s a bit silly. That plus too much sentences we have heard before &#34;the hacker is in florida, or no, he is in madrid, no he is in ... , he is screwing the signal&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10&#39;,
 &#39;Okay - I\&#39;ll confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney, with charm to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast are solid workers all, and will step right up and do a fine job in this \&#39;80s comedy. A spoof of the \&#39;30s-\&#39;40s gangster movies, it breaks new ground constantly, with remarkably original material. (Well, yeah - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made, it was original, and much of it has _not_ been copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people to not do ______, with one of the great taglines of spoofs. Watch Roman Moronie do things with English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing sight gags, such as pet-store owner Johnny Kelly using the price-tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens. Watch the greatest &#34;warning against sex&#34; educational film ever made. Watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church Latin done, while a guy who never took shop class assembles a Thompson machine gun from parts. Watch lines you\&#39;ll be using in casual conversation for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard-working mom, with surprise gags that you\&#39;ll never see coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you see a gag that doesn\&#39;t hit your funny bone, be patient - another will come along in 30 seconds or less, and the odds are, you\&#39;ll need to pause until you\&#39;re done rolling on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? Them, too. Watch for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few minor flaws - but it\&#39;s probably the best of the spoofs. Some come close, but none of them are quite this good.&#39;,
 &#34;As a Westerner watching another culture&#39;s view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. There&#39;s song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.&#34;,
 &#39;Entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices Sky Masterson to try and get salvation army girl, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 years later, Simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous &#34;Elmer Gantry.&#34; There she was sister Sharon and here she is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Sinatra is that devilish Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually did his own singing here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is saved by superlative choreography. Those dance and singing routines are fabulous. They are especially realized by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it\&#39;s a very nice production.&#39;,
 &#34;I am never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hongkong or even China. Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I don&#39;t consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie&#39;s acting is sub par as she &#39;over-act&#39;, trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.&#34;,
 &#39;!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You`d think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . In fact I`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That`s why I wrote &#34; Possible spoiler &#34; it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film . In fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes GREY OWL , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor&#39;,
 &#34;The third Fred MacMurray/Carole Lombard film is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It&#39;s yet another adaption of the play Burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original play Burlesque ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and it&#39;s the role that Carole Lombard plays that Barbara Stanwyck originated on Broadway that brought her to Hollywood. A version starred Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey did still another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact I have a vinyl album of a radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. That&#39;s an interesting work, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway MacMurray and Lombard do fine by the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Note a nice performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin vixen who gets between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for Lombard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swing High, Swing Low holds up real nice today and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we see yet another version of Burlesque for the Twenty First Century.&#34;,
 &#39;It just seems bizarre that someone read this script, and thought, &#34;This is funny! I mean, it\&#39;s so hilarious it just has to be made!&#34; Who was this person? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Are they the one\&#39;s who owe me for my time, more so than the director/writer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film stinks in most every way possible. There\&#39;s no one shred of good dialogue, and not one likable character. And the story...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the 2nd worst movie ever, Hulk Hogan\&#39;s &#34;No Hold\&#39;s Barred&#34; to this by quite a considerable degree. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes, and it\&#39;s still under 80 minutes. The outtakes include cast members laughing at the \&#39;hilarious\&#39; mistakes they\&#39;ve made, and things that went wrong on the set of this \&#39;comedy.\&#39; Glad to see someone laughing in someway, with some connection to this \&#39;film.\&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing in this film is funny. Nothing. It just goes on, and on. It\&#39;s truly that lame. I love films that are so bad they\&#39;re good. This is so bad it\&#39;s...something, but I don\&#39;t know what, and hopefully will never find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Peet doesn\&#39;t suck outright, and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film. But, that really means little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid at all costs.&#39;,
 &#34;This long episode packs amount of astounding of surprises, thriller, mystery and concerns about a battle of wits of Sherlock against Charles Augustus Milverton, a master blackmailer. This is an excellent overlong runtime of Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film appear usual Holmes&#39;s cannon as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs Hudson, though no Moriarty, however is a greatest villain, Charles Augustus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue, thrills, and suspense, including an exciting final twist. This is a particular Sherlock movie but we find to Holmes falling in love with a servant, kissing, crying and even robbing. This time along with the episode ¨Scandal in Boheme¨ with Irene Adler, result to be the only one which Holmes is enamored. Top-notch Brett performance, he alongside Peter Cushing are the best Sherlock TV , while in the cinema is forever Basil Rathbone. Brett performs as a resolutive, headstrong, impetuous sleuth. Here Doctor Watson isn&#39;t a comic, botcher, and clumsy pal personified by Nigel Bruce, but is an astute and cunning partner well incarnated by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpoint of Brett. Casting is frankly magnificent, special mention to Robert Hardy as astute nasty. Hardy, today famous by role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several success such as, The 10th kingdom and Winston Churchill. Furthermore appear secondaries actors with terrific performances, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others. The movie gets a colorful atmosphere , the London streets and 221 Baker Street&#39;s house are well designed. The motion picture is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It&#39;s a must see for the Arthur Conan Doyle fans.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie is just crap. Even though the directors claim to be part of that oi-culture, it\&#39;s still a very, very bad directorial debut. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact, that they are all amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing. There\&#39;s no timing at all in that movie. I felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie (it\&#39;s their first feature), that they actually never really asked themselves, what story they wanna tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he\&#39;s a nice and thoughtful guy, but that doesn\&#39;t make him a director. I think, that &#34;American History X&#34; is full of clichés, but somehow manages to transport a story. &#34;Oi!Warning&#34; is full of clichés, doesn\&#39;t tell anything new or provocative and (-that\&#39;s the sad thing about this movie) it\&#39;s far from any Oi!-Reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wanna see weird but great German films, watch the movies of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny\&#39;s Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** out of ten, because of the topic and the photography&#39;,
 &#34;this movie I saw some 10 years ago (maybe more), I took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in French sites. The end is very surprising and intelligent. I would like very much to watch it again because I think it&#39;s as surpring as the Sixth Sense althogh a completely different kind of movie.&#34;,
 &#39;1st watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): Fairly lame account of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much-heralded event. The replication of the disaster is not bad, but the drama around it is at some times silly, badly acted and way-too soap opera-like. The story is very much the same as the most recent Oscar-winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late. Good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what James Cameron was competing against(barely\x85) in his recreation.&#39;,
 &#39;I saw an interview with Rob Schneider (who plays the lead character, Marvin Mange, in this film.) He said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you\&#39;d be laughing at this movie. Obviously that must be the secret. I had the volume turned up. I was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster, and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after Schneider\&#39;s hilarious performance in &#34;Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is stupid: Mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton), and as a result starts to lose control of his &#34;animal instincts.&#34; This makes him a &#34;supercop.&#34; He can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses. Of course, he also has a nasty habit of eating people\&#39;s cows and trying to seduce their goats, but surely that\&#39;s a small price to pay? It just didn\&#39;t do anything for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast left much to be desired. Is there a more irritating actor in all of Hollywood than John McGinley? Here, he plays Sgt. Sisk, Mange\&#39;s commander on the police force, as a repugnantly cartoonish character (much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular TV series &#34;Scrubs.&#34;) I was anxious to get a look at Colleen Haskell\&#39;s first &#34;serious&#34; acting job (can anything in this movie be called &#34;serious?&#34;) She, of course, gained her fame as a contestant on the first &#34;Survivor&#34; and she proves here what we knew from that: she\&#39;s cute as a button. What she doesn\&#39;t prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress. And what\&#39;s with Ed Asner as Police Chief Wilson. I mean, how old is this guy now? He\&#39;s the size of some of the cows Mange tried to eat, and he seemed out of breath the whole way through. I\&#39;m surprised he made it through the filming. There\&#39;s a brief cameo at the end by Adam Sandler (who also served as Executive Producer of this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I chuckled twice: Mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car, and the scene Schneider has with Haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more acting talent! So, for two chuckles - 2/10.&#39;,
 &#39;Why can\&#39;t more directors these days create horror movies like &#34;The Shining&#34;? There\&#39;s an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as &#34;scary&#34;. It\&#39;s some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick\&#39;s movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn\&#39;t disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I must comment on Nicholson\&#39;s legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R.I.P. Stanley.&#39;,
 &#39;All dogs go to Heaven is one of the best movies I\&#39;ve ever seen. I first saw it when I was like 3. Now I\&#39;m 12 and I rented it, it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories, those were &#34;the days&#34;. I love the music, I love when Charlie is arriving in Heaven, I love the song &#34;Let me be surprised&#34;. I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play Charlie\&#39;s voice this great. I love this movie, the 1st one is the best one because it\&#39;s so original and great. It really does bring back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love the characters. If this is the way the memories come back when I\&#39;m 12 imagine how I\&#39;ll feel when I\&#39;m like 19, I hope I\&#39;ll be able to watch this when I\&#39;m older. When I first seen this I never knew that I would really look back on it and feel this way , I hope it will be available to watch. I\&#39;m so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. On a scale from 1-10 I\&#39;d give it a perfect 10. It\&#39;s an amazing movie. It\&#39;s so hard to explain the feeling, when I get older and if I have kids, I hope they can experience this feeling.&#39;,
 &#34;Gundam Wing is an amazing show from start to finish, every single episode is a joy to watch. The story is typical Gundam fare, in the future Earth&#39;s populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand. The story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other Gundam show. It is the year After Colony 195 and the corrupt Earth government, known as the Earth Sphere Alliance, is violently taking over the free colonies. To combat the Alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come (an evil militaristic organization hiding within the Alliance known as OZ, which later takes control of Earth and the colonies), select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to Earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come. These mechs, known as Gundams, fight OZ and try to regain peace in the colonies as OZ takes the front-stage, completely eliminating the Alliance and taking control of Earth and its colonies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gundam Wing as I previously stated, is probably the most enjoyable Gundam series to watch in my opinion. A large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other Gundam series before it, but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other Gundam series. Gundam Wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other Gundam show I have ever seen thus far. This particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, this show still has many epic battles within it, and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other Gundam series have, but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable Gundam series out there, and I strongly recommend it to any fan of anime, or sci-fi in general. The show sports some amazing animation and superb action, but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more. The characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them. This show is definitely one that shouldn&#39;t be missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect 10/10!&#34;,
 &#39;Ritchie\&#39;s first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. Here, he raids two recent classics \x96 \&#39;The Usual Suspects\&#39; and \&#39;Fight Club\&#39; \x96 and still comes out empty-handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite parading itself as a con-mystery (with the sub-\&#39;Usual Suspects\&#39; twaddle &#34;the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you&#34; or whatever it was...) and attempting a \&#39;Fight-Club\&#39; twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. By the last third, you know you\&#39;re being lead down a blind alley, and tediously slowly at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is Ritchie\&#39;s bold way with with a scene and Maurice-Jones\&#39;s dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there\&#39;s no reason why he couldn\&#39;t have made another enjoyable gangster caper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. If you want to see a great film that doesn\&#39;t make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch \&#39;Lost Highway\&#39;.&#39;,
 &#34;I usually steer clear of TV movies because of the many ways you know that it&#39;s TV movies five seconds into the picture. This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-crafted mood that is established from the very start. While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver, B.C.), the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement Olmos&#39; excellent acting.&#34;,
 &#34;After watching the trailer I was surprised this movie never made it into theaters, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there. Of course, it has its flaws but I can still really recommend it. The animation is well done, very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end. Some of the backdrops are just drop-dead gorgeous and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought that Forest Whitaker&#39;s performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character Lian-Chu is depicted in this movie. So overall, thumbs up, I liked it a lot and I hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this. I would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget. Hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are Stitch-like hilarious.&#34;,
 &#39;A pretty memorable movie of the animals-killing-people variety, specifically similar to &#34;Willard&#34; in that it stars an aging character actor (in this case, a step down a bit to the level of Les Tremayne, who puts in the only distinguished performance I\&#39;ve seen him give) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him. Yes, this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable, so that you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. couldn\&#39;t be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tremayne\&#39;s character is &#34;Snakey Bender&#34;, and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: an aged snake collector who is obsessed with John Philip Souza\&#39;s music. When the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend gets married to a stripper (thus upsetting his ritual Wednesday night band concert) he goes on the rampage, in the process creating a memorable pile-up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners. One amusing game you can play while watching &#34;Snakes&#34; is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.&#39;,
 &#39;This is just as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more of her this time round. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather bumbling male lead. To use Paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea. The movie is well worth watching whatever your age, provided you like animals.&#39;,
 &#39;I just finished watching this movie. I was very excited since I\&#39;m a big fan of Punk Rock, Horror films and Spoofs. I was very surprised at what I saw. I knew it was low budget, but I wasn\&#39;t expecting it to be taped with a video camera. It opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, The Horrorpops, reforming their song, Where They Wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. It\&#39;s a great opening. But the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. A live performance, A death. Another live performance, A death. It gets old. And there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. Why doesn\&#39;t the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? Don\&#39;t get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. Like the hardcore French band, known simply as BERET, the prospect of a band named Atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and Bowling For Soup\&#39;s Overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that I will save for the future watchers of this movie. But the big problem I have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the &#34;actors&#34;. Especially Warped Tour creator, Kevin Lyman. He tries very hard, but I suspect that he didn\&#39;t want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something. In addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the DVD. The Movie\&#39;s resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and Lloyd Kaufman as the devil. Bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent Horror, Music, or Comedy film. Although I have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that I would never have listened to, otherwise. Such as Tsunami Bomb, and the Phenomonauts(an insane, Psychobilly band). I recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on. If not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances. They rock! Long live Punk Rock and Horror!&#39;,
 &#34;Seriously, there is absolutely NOTHING good about this crap fest at all. Randolph Scott, a closet homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is at his most wooden and boring in the least role. At 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles, although it doesn&#39;t matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn&#39;t enough to save this garbage. Thank God they don&#39;t make westerns any more, they&#39;re just dated, racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/10.&#34;,
 &#39;In the words of Charles Dance\&#39;s character in this film, &#34;Bollocks!&#34; No plot, no character development, and utterly unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of stuff that just doesn\&#39;t happen in the real world (since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters?). Full of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of dull and artificial dialogue. And the directing/editing is awful - wobbly hand-held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness; confusing jump-cuts; no structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wesley Snipes\&#39; character is totally unsympathetic - why should we care what happens to him? Direct to video? Direct to the dustbin!&#39;,
 &#39;WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS, in my opinion, is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Anytime Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to vomit myself. It\&#39;s kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents. Before I wrap this up, I\&#39;d like to say, &#34;If you ask me, WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person\&#39;s body. &#34; Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn\&#39;t seen it. You\&#39;re in for some tears and a good time, so the next time it\&#39;s on TV, kick back with a friend and watch it.&#39;,
 &#34;Seriously, I don&#39;t even know where to begin. It&#39;s like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said &#39;make me a movie about the secret service&#39;. The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s a SPOILER for you; this movie is the dumbest thing you&#39;ll ever see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you liked this piece, you&#39;ll also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.&#34;,
 &#39;A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul, (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose Reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and his sons, there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow progression of the brothers\&#39; lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching movie narrated by the director, Robert Redford, playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closing lines sum up the &#34;point&#34; of the movie: &#34;Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world\&#39;s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched this movie just a little while ago and I found that this movie was terrible! It moved very slowly and was hardly entertaining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for all those that liked it.... this is only my opinion!&#39;,
 &#39;I saw this film when I was a young child on television (thank-you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada\&#39;s National Film Board\&#39;s best animators. Pojar was, in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see &#34;Night Angel&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The symbolism is obvious, but deftly used. The oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small room where the action takes place is the character\&#39;s entire world. The invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful and haunting film. I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by Trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids. A must see.&#39;,
 &#34;The plot of &#39;House of Games&#39; is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters, but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge. That&#39;s about the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets. It has to be the director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and pretty steady TV and film career, so she can&#39;t perform this badly all the time. She&#39;s supposed to go from uptight, cool, controlled professional to calculating, wicked fast lady having fun, as shown by the change from beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear) to floppy floral sundress. But everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped, precise way; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed. The effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. At times &#39;House of Games&#39; loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot. The clunky vibes&#39;n&#39;oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn&#39;t help either. The ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic, two-dimensional performances. And they smoke too much!!!&#34;,
 &#34;The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (current day Sri Lanka). Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark, and almost eerie, undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful I&#39;ve seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.&#34;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s sad to view this film now that we know how the ANC got shafted by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing much. Woods achieved little. Yes, outright apartheid was abolished, but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent. As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine, in the talks between the black and white leaderships &#34;the deKlerk government had a twofold strategy. First drawing on the ascendant Washington Consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy, it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as &#34;technical&#34; or &#34;adminsitrative&#34;. Then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the ANC.&#34; The statistical results are horrifying, with not much change accomplished, and AIDS flourishing. Viewing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic. The ANC has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh, Talespin! What can I say that hasn\&#39;t already been said about this great show? Nothing! This is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows I\&#39;ve ever encountered, live-action or animation. The newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes, and some of the &#34;mature&#34; stuff I have to shoo kids out of the room for. But not Talespin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories are engaging and very plausible. Some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike. Then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays(at least, those which aren\&#39;t specifically geared toward it), especially in cartoons. In the episode Stormy Weather for instance, Kit Cloudkicker decides that he\&#39;s going to join an air circus, but Baloo believes that it would be too dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, to which Kit screams &#34;NO! You can\&#39;t tell me what to do! YOUR\&#39;RE *NOT* *MY* *DAD*!&#34; and buries his face in his pillow. The next day he leaves for the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Characters have a lot of depth to them. Baloo is pretty much the way he is in The Jungle Book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money, while good in theory, are seldom good in practice. Molly is a cute little girl, but you can\&#39;t let that deceive you. She can be a real hellion sometimes. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He doesn\&#39;t trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships. Watch his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: he looks as though he\&#39;s prepared to put it right through a pirate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it\&#39;s the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show #1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is demonstrated well in All\&#39;s Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo takes Kit\&#39;s word for it that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults. Baloo and Becky\&#39;s relationship is also realistic, due to Baloo\&#39;s motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol\&#39; Sea Duck, not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he did get the Duck back he\&#39;d still do jobs for Rebecca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed. The plane\&#39;s functions don\&#39;t change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other &#34;super-planes&#34; of other cartoons, it doesn\&#39;t have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!), and relies instead on it\&#39;s cunning pilot\&#39;s great skill to get out of trouble. It\&#39;s hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn\&#39;t have some sort of gun turret, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. Plus it\&#39;s just such a darn cool design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!&#39;,
 &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the lead actress is STRIKINGLY beautiful, the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950&#39;s easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old&#39;s they barely know, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been, more often than not, teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of Stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake, but I think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into, and hang around inside, a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble, but I think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final nit, throughout Hey Babu Riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome. There is probably an explanation why the FIVE were the FOURsome, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie did not ring true for me.&#34;,
 &#39;There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it\&#39;s a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zorro\&#39;s Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First off, it\&#39;s a Republic serial in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead by workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big difference is that the setting isn\&#39;t California. The story here take place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny &#34;twang&#34; bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. But overall, this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time, and probably the best Zorro one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there\&#39;s lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.&#39;,
 &#34;I saw this when I was 17 and haven&#39;t seen it since. The &#39;CBS Late Movie&#39; used to show it on a regular basis at one point. I remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach. Effects then weren&#39;t what they are today, but nevertheless, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after losing both parents and searching for a way out, very well. I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh. It&#39;s a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time, even though likely it was strongly edited for TV. I wish I remembered more details, and if I ever get the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I have been looking for this for years. I believe it may have been shown on CBS under yet another title. I have no idea whether it was ever released on video.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry but I didn&#39;t like this doc very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously don&#39;t have much imagination. The interviews aren&#39;t very interesting and no real insight is offered. The footage isn&#39;t assembled in a very informative way, either. It&#39;s too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I&#39;ll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. All considered, this only gets a &#39;4.&#39;&#34;,
 &#34;This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house. The father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California, and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best education possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things really become funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray&#39;s niece, comes to lives with the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Walter costars as a woman who wants Murray to move in with her since she wants a companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in towards the end. They play Murray&#39;s brother and sister-in-law respectively; they&#39;re also the parents of Tomei. In front of the children, Reiner lets loose reminding Murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around Beverly Hills in their car. I guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self-esteem.&#34;,
 &#39;OK, I didn\&#39;t know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido, honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention. But when I was looking around in Netflix, they were advertising this like crazy if I liked &#34;goofy&#34; scary movies, so I figured to just give it a shot. I\&#39;m so glad that I did watch it, this was just a great movie, it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch. Like I said, it\&#39;s Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead, it\&#39;s just a great concept, what does happen after a mega zombie attack? As we see in another zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead, they have fun by making the zombies left over as &#34;handy&#34; citizens. This is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie, I think a lot of people were just so blown away with Shaun of the Dead that this got the boot. But it\&#39;s a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. This radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named Zomcon. Zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies\&#39; hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants. In the town of Willard, a housewife ,Helen, buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill\&#39;s zombie phobia. Their son, Timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him &#34;Fido&#34;. One day Fido\&#39;s collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy &#34;kills&#34; the zombified neighbor. When a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor, they capture Fido and Timmy. Helen comes and rescues Timmy and Fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor\&#39;s body is found and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to Zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through a friend that Fido is simply working in a factory at Zomcon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get Fido back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it\&#39;s so silly but a lot of fun. Billy Connelly did a great job as Fido and really brought, no pun intended, a lot of life into the character. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Timmy has to burry the old lady that Fido attacked and killed, his last words to her were so funny, &#34;you weren\&#39;t really nice, but you liked flowers, so\x85&#34; and he buries her in the garden. Not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend, sick, disturbing, wrong, but classic laughs. I still love how even though this is like the Leave It To Beaver-esquire type of world, there still is a lot of gore in the movie. So if you do have a chance to see Fido, take it, I promise some good laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#39;,
 &#34;Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don&#39;t provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it&#39;s obviously a style of film that Americans haven&#39;t really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about, but DON&#39;T say I didn&#39;t warn you...&#34;,
 &#34;I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn&#39;t have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark&#39;s worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as &#39;The Bully&#39;, and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can&#39;t recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He&#39;s a veteran of Clark&#39;s films now and he was so brilliant in &#39;Kids&#39;, but in &#39;Bully&#39; he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn&#39;t fathom Clark&#39;s intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids&#39; existence? It sure as hell didn&#39;t stop him getting in a damn good perv. I&#39;m no prude but I didn&#39;t need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark&#39;s best film is &#39;Another Day in Paradise&#39;. It&#39;s fantastic and I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever top it.&#34;,
 &#34;I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It&#39;s not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won&#39;t blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it&#39;s not a waste of time, either. It&#39;s the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren&#39;t in the mood to think too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won&#39;t be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV.&#34;,
 &#34;Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former Assistant District Attorney, Kate Capshaw and he&#39;s a crusader against capital punishment. Blair Underwood&#39;s grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson&#39;s appeal. He&#39;s sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Connery arrives in this rural Florida county he&#39;s up against a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne who&#39;s about as ruthless in his crime solving as Orson Welles was in Touch of Evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on after Connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he&#39;s uncovered, he&#39;s feeling pretty good about himself. At that point the film takes a decided turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly. The cast uniformly turns in some good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris who plays a Hannibal Lecter like serial killer on death row with Underwood. He will make your skin crawl and he starts making Connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he&#39;s been basing his convictions on. Many a confirmed liberal I&#39;ve known has come out thinking quite differently once they&#39;ve become a crime victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the reverse is equally true. Many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.&#34;,
 &#39;This mess is so bad it doesn\&#39;t even qualify as horror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie Rochon\&#39;s talent is completely wasted in this film. She is not even the villain. The rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame I won\&#39;t even mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band TwoMarlowe perform &#34;Better Than Sex&#34; it\&#39;s total 80\&#39;s Disco candy song. Nice up tempo song about Gambleing &amp; Sex. Way more entertaining than &#34;Bleed&#34;. Put it this way, When one has the equipment to copy videos, but decides only to record the song at the end of movie, you have a really &#34;BAD&#34; movie.&#39;,
 &#39;A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon\&#39;s seed. The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific, but, instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death, despite the title itself. Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twist with it\&#39;s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go, never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to &#34;The End&#34;..&#39;,
 &#34;This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective, so I was hooked by the time the title came on. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to re-invent themselves, but not in a tricky way like Identity or the Usual Suspects, but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting. The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular. At one point Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a seminar in laughing, where he&#39;s the worst student. His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself. The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people I see every day. There&#39;s not a lot of plot here. Guessing the old man&#39;s secret is pretty easy, but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out. This movie appealed to me in the same way that Sideways did, although the characters couldn&#39;t be more dissimilar.&#34;,
 &#39;Famous was &#34;famous&#34; for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi-main character is in terrible peril, only to be rescued by the hero at the last second. This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The constant in Famous Studios cartoons is that &#34;virtue always triumphs&#34;. Popeye always gets to his spinach in time, Baby Huey always out-foxes the fox, Little Audery always &#34;learns her lesson&#34;. And some FS cartoons ARE really dark and depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to give them credit. as much as I love Looney Tunes and &#34;Tom and Jerry&#34; I don\&#39;t think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer.&#39;,
 &#39;Thre isn\&#39;t a single Scorsese movie I\&#39;d place on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best thing I\&#39;ve run through my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese\&#39;s patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s 3 DVD-sides worth of material. It would have to be a British production, since everything about American corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here. And an American production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone took a page from his love of movies. You should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just more &#34;Me-too&#34; votes for The Godfather, etc.. People have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese DOES know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic. I really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he\&#39;s excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when he\&#39;s didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. And I do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. It\&#39;s very distracting.&#39;,
 &#39;This movie should not classify as cinema. Although it is over 10 years old now, it should never, ever have gotten funding, and is a blight on the Australian Film Industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as &#34;The Dish&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Actors cannot act, The music is.. to be blunt, not music, the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not watch this film. It is a complete waste of your time.&#39;,
 &#34;I have been reading the reviews for this movie and now I wanna kill my self. I don&#39;t wanna live in a world where people find this move or Rob Schneider funny. What is wrong with these people. I&#39;m not angry at Rob Schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat. I watched this film in disbelief. Who would pay money to make this?? This film is so bad that its painful. Most bad films are funny because they are crap. The Animal is just DISGUSTING!!! Watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self. We don&#39;t need you. I want to raise money to get Rob Scheider off all movies. If someone killed Rob Schneider they should be given a Nobel peace prize.&#34;,
 &#39;I think that movie can`t be a Scott`s film. That is impossible. Do you remember Blade Runner? And Alien? Two greats movies versus a one. I hope didn´t see ever it. good bye!!&#39;,
 &#34;As with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters. But whilst C + J eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood, this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism. Most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet, despite their deeply un-PC behaviour, everyone emerges smiling. Like C + G, through it all they remain innocents at heart, rebels against the quotidien, the bourgeois, the restrictive. As someone else has commented, I wouldn&#39;t want to know these 2 and it&#39;s a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door) and thus for that reason, it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth. Dare I say that only the French can get away with films like this. And that is part of their genius.&#34;,
 &#39;Debbie Reynolds toe-taps, tangos and, yes, tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated \&#39;30s atmosphere. Two ladies, brought together when their sons commit a murder, try starting their lives over by running a tap-dance school for tots in Hollywood. Trouble is, one of them is plagued by neuroses. Can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford...? Nahh, Bette never would have allowed Joan so much screen-time to strut her stuff, and I can\&#39;t imagine Bette Davis in the other role, tap-dancing her heart out. This is a purely bogus piece of macabre, written by a slumming Henry Farrell (whose idea of a good &#34;shock&#34; is to stage the mass-murder of a group of rabbits!). Not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package. *1/2 from ****&#39;,
 &#39;This is a typical 70\&#39;s soft core sex romp in the Russ Meyer genre, though perhaps less outlandish than some of Meyer\&#39;s work. This film has higher \&#39;production values\&#39; than many of it\&#39;s contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It\&#39;s plot, writing and acting are straight out the B zone, though. Of late, this film has become a mainstay of B movie channels (such as &#34;Drive In Classics&#34;) in the 500 channel universe. If soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is as &#34;good&#34; as anything else in the B range. Don\&#39;t expect Polanski though, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles performance as the &#34;mother&#34; is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film went on to greater fame, unsurprisingly. Confessions of a Young American Housewife is far from the worst example of it\&#39;s kind. It is watchable, if this is your type of film. 30 years ago, this would have been an avant garde and riske film. You can see more or less the same kind of thing on Showtime/HBO series these days, and in prime time.&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I&#39;ve been feeling down in the dumps and it&#39;s such a lovely little fairytale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I&#39;ve been for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very funny and clever movie. The running joke of the kingdom&#39;s history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. That&#39;s much of what makes it so good; it&#39;s an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.&#34;,
 &#39;The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things that Hollywood doesn\&#39;t make anymore. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive, and heart-felt movies that I have ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce, and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, deliver Oscar Winning caliber performances! There are not enough words to express how great this movie is. Sure, people who are not into sentimental movies may not care as much as the rest of us about Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this movie goes right to the heart and sole of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this film, EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****SPOILERS BELOW*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple yet eloquent story is masterfully told. Eugene is a med-school intern who faces long hours and a demanding work load at the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a little slow and awkward because of brain damage due to a victim of abuse by their father. (A heartbreaking moment when this is found out in the film that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (a.k.a &#34;Geno&#34;) faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish medical school, which would mean accepting his residency in another city and leave Dominick (a.k.a &#34;Nicky&#34;) behind, or forfeit the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay his brother\&#39;s med-school tuition by working as a trash collector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The questions of ethics, morals, and responsibilities are masterfully blended in this landmark movie. Just when Gino thinks Nicky might be making progress toward independence, Dominick turns around and winds up doing things like helping out a drug dealer, or tying to use a faulty cord that he finds at the dump on an electrical appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry, is &#34;The Character&#34; and Nicky\&#39;s partner on his garbage route who fills gullible Dominick\&#39;s head with all kinds of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, whom he is tutoring in Clinical Pharmacology) going to Atlantic City and gambling away all their money. But deep down, you can see that Larry cares for him. On their rounds, Nicky also befriends a little boy, whom we find out has also been beaten by his father. An end result is also tragic and the pain that you see on Nicky\&#39;s face when it happens, speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity that the two brothers share for each other can not be overstated enough. All Nicky wants to do is be loved and look for acceptance in anyway he can. (i.e he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough so that Geno can pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have gotten tons more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately came out around the same time as Rain Man, which dealt with a similar issue. However, I like Dominick and Eugene better because it has a far stronger emotional component. Be forewarned that this movie is aimed right at the tear-ducts, so have Kleenex handy! What a film!!!!&#39;,
 &#39;I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a &#34;good&#34; message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film\&#39;s only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the &#34;Time Machine&#34; probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.&#39;,
 &#39;With a movie called &#34;Gayniggers from Outer Space&#34; how could you go wrong? Just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the Village People as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. Plot is unimportant. Too bad, this film doesn\&#39;t contain any of this and every joke misses the spot. The characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title made me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more about the film. My expectation were to high apparently.&#39;,
 &#34;I blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that I paid as much as I did but I would say that it&#39;s at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting. It is not a good movie in any way but I must say that I was pretty darn entertained. I guess it could be called so-bad-it&#39;s-good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the acting is awful, I feel like I could have done a better job showing, at least, any emotion. The story is nothing new and has been done better. I guess I just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film. I would say rent this or download it but definitely don&#39;t buy it. It is not worth more than one watch.&#34;,
 &#34;THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number 1 - Television Show of all Time &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn&#39;t go past a pilot episode. The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying, loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious, greying consiglieri who is often very funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi, and to an extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore, other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. This is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters&#39; lives, which makes the whole thing more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini, for envisioning, television&#39;s most complex and enigmatic character. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;,
 &#39;To borrow from Dorothy Parker: This is not a film to be tossed aside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lightly. It should be thrown with great force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excruciating mess. And I\&#39;m a Greenaway fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIND-NUMBINGLY AWFUL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Mummy Returns&#34; has much more artistic merit&#39;,
 &#34;Possible spoilers re: late-appearing cameos &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seldom does one see so many fine &amp; memorable character actors (almost entirely actresses to be precise) in one film. Even though a few only appear for cameos, each one is a gem. The British do this mix of comedy and real-life pathos better than anyone IMO, so it is no surprise that most of the actors are Brits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is great; no doubt much had to be dubbed (does Leslie Caron *really* play the bass so well? maybe - who knew?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aging musician myself, not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course, it was a heartening film as well -- a great film for anyone whose wondering if they&#39;re past it in their profession or avocation whatever it may be. And of course a great celebration of the life of the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed a little of the opening, but a provisional 9/10 -- and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing.&#34;,
 &#34;You can do a lot with a little cash. Blair Witch proved that. This film supports it. It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity. However, because it has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn&#39;t afford a shoestring. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as the sincere, bumbling Watson, his dimness and slowness foils Cleese&#39;s quick-tempered wit. If you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two.&#34;,
 &#39;I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of these. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have realized that it couldn\&#39;t possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a starring role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One poster here called the movie incoherent. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I am so glad I got it from the library for free, yet I still feel ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMDb needs to include a &#34;0&#34; in the &#34;rate this film&#34; vote, just for movies like this one.&#39;,
 &#34;No need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here goes the summary: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous - the colors are superb - would love to have it done in silk as a necktie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The story and execution is a total snooze - it was quite difficult to stay awake at times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a student of the fine arts, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so forth - have at it. This is a FILM for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an engaging, entertaining MOVIE - look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vikings didn&#39;t have horns by the way...&#34;,
 &#39;this was a fantastic episode. i saw a clip from it on YouTube, and i vowed that should it ever show on TV, i would glue myself to the set in order to watch. i wound up watching it with a friend of mine, who happens to be gay, and the two of us cried at the end. this was a truly well-written, heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who, i felt, really were (in Coop\&#39;s words) &#34;the Lucky Ones&#34;. it is episodes like this one that really make Cold Case one of the most captivating and much-loved works of television magic on CBS. i anxiously await more episodes, and a re-run of &#34;Forever Blue&#34; because i will always watch it again and again.&#39;,
 &#34;Johnny Weissmuller&#39;s final film as &#39;King of the Jungle&#39;, after 16 years in the role, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans. At 44, the ex-Olympian, one of Hollywood&#39;s most active &#39;party animals&#39;, was long past the slim athleticism of his youth, and looked tired (although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry, TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the quintessential &#39;Boy&#39;, had grown to manhood (he was a strapping 17-year old), so he was written out of the script, under the pretext of being &#39;away at school&#39;. Brenda Joyce, at 35, was appearing in her fourth of five films as &#39;Jane&#39; (she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, in 1949&#39;s TARZAN&#39;S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produced by Sol Lesser, at RKO, on a minuscule budget, the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively, incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young island girl (Tyrone Power&#39;s future bride, Linda Christian) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan, he learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of filmdom&#39;s most enduring villains) had virtually enslaved the local population, threatening retribution from a living &#39;God&#39; if they don&#39;t do his bidding. The girl had been chosen to become the &#39;God&#39;s&#39; bride, so she fled. Faster than you can say &#39;Is this a dumb plot or WHAT?&#39;, the girl is kidnapped by the priest&#39;s henchmen and returned to the island, and Tarzan, followed by Jane, colorful Spanish character &#39;Benjy&#39; (charmingly played by John Laurenz, who sings several tunes), and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the &#39;God&#39; is simply a con man in an Aztec mask, working with the priest in milking the island&#39;s rich pearl beds), a bit of brawling action, and comic relief and songs by Benjy, everything reaches the expected happy conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remarkably, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, and is far better than what you&#39;d expect from this &#39;B&#39; movie! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to Weissmuller&#39;s time in Tarzan&#39;s loincloth (he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man, in khakis), the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarzan was about to get a make over, and become much sexier...&#34;,
 &#34;Well then, thank you SO MUCH Disney for DESTROYING the fond memories I USED to have of my FORMER favorite movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So, now that I&#39;m 16, and feeling masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. Thus, I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it, right down to the last detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show her to everyone in the ocean...BROADWAY STYLE! After the musical number ends, within minutes, the sea witch Morgana shows up and threatens to kill Melody if Triton doesn&#39;t give up the trident. Thus, he gives it up without even a fight. Eric stands there gaping, though Ariel figures out how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgana is caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...uh, nothing of note really happens. Eric is a total wuss. He never really manages to do anything. Ariel sort of does something. Melody manages to screw things up. Plus, the animation is a new low-point for Disney. The computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds. Ever single opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, don&#39;t waste your time. I&#39;m pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this, since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens. They won&#39;t want to sing the songs. If you manage to grab a copy of this, throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it. Ever.&#34;,
 &#34;I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since I had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but I came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money I had paid for it. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. If that doesn&#39;t thrill you, then stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is shot on a home video camera, with grade school props and terrible actors. It&#39;s dubbed from German, but even allowing for that, the sound is awful. This film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film might have been a little more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. They are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. I call this a story in the loosest sense, since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie, unless you like mindless gore. Consider yourself warned.&#34;,
 &#39;I waited until the 4th of July to write this because . . . well . . . because it just feels right to be doing it on this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1924 D.W. Griffith needed a hit, he had not had a big one since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). He\&#39;d been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences. He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the American Revolution. This movie is the result. By the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn\&#39;t a trace of Patrick Henry anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know the story of the Revolutionary War but Griffith threw in a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton) falling in love with Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, a leading lady for Griffith for many years). Complicating matters is the fact that Nancy\&#39;s father hates Nathan . . . well not just Nathan, he hates all rebels. It does not help matters when, during a skirmish on the streets of Lexington someone jostles Nathan\&#39;s arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound Nancy\&#39;s dad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paralelling the love story is the (mostly true but partially embellished) story of Capt. Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) a renegade British officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one. With Thousands of Indians form the Six Nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) are inevitable. The Montague family might just as well be the Cameron\&#39;s from the earlier film while Nathan could be a part of the Stoneman family. The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is staged very similarly to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army, in this case the Redcoats, storming a trench packed with Patriots. The only thing missing is Henry Walthall charging across No Man\&#39;s Land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon. Amazingly enough the battle scenes in America seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in BIRTH and fail to draw the audience in. Something is clearly missing. It isn\&#39;t scope, G.W. &#34;Billy&#34; Bitzer\&#39;s camera work is quite good. Maybe what is missing is . . . dare I say it . . . sincerity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brutality of Capt. Butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen. Don\&#39;t expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one scene Butler\&#39;s second in command, Capt. Hare (Louis Wolhiem) gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist. We see only the beginning of the deed, for the remainder the camera focuses on Hare\&#39;s face as he obviously has a good time doing this. Lionel had been working with Griffith on and off since 1912. A story goes that he approached Griffith for work and D.W., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said &#34;I am not hiring stage actors.&#34; to which Lionel replied &#34;And I am nothing of the kind, sir!&#34; He makes a very good and quite believable villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared with Lionel\&#39;s older brother John three times; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (both 1920) and later in THE TEMPEST (1927). As Capt. Hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Hamilton later remarked that America was his first time on horseback and &#34;I was scared to death.&#34;. He hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over. Mr. Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked her to marry him. She refused and soon left his stock company, after which her star status gradually waned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of horses, one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of Paul Revere\&#39;s ride. He rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce &#34;To arms! The Regulars are coming!&#34; but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground! I am amazed Griffith did not do another take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is America a classic? YES! Don\&#39;t wait for July 4th to see it, it is enjoyable anytime.&#39;,
 &#39;***SPOILERS*** All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy\&#39;s unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy\&#39;s good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It\&#39;s when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy\&#39;s proposal of marriage to her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who\&#39;s still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City\&#39;s underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy\&#39;s life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a &#34;Valentine Day&#34; like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It\&#39;s at Fred\&#39;s circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn\&#39;t have the heart to do, for him!&#39;,
 &#34;One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action packed (and graphic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking up a year or so after Tarzan the Ape Man, Niel Hamilton&#39;s Holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory. His Friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan. Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition. When they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded. They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire. Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence (Its graphic even by todays standards. It probably would get a PG 13) and to remove all hint of nudity, (there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving Jane that is full frontal in its nudity, it was only recently restored). Its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for TV. As it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic, touching, action filled and everything else that a movie should be. Its an amazing film by almost any standard. Best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure, one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it, but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film. Its an amazing thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this film a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any flaws to the film, its perhaps that the film hasn&#39;t aged well. The rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing. However on almost every other level this film is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really owe it to yourself to see this. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.&#34;,
 &#34;I saw Brother&#39;s Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother&#39;s wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. Also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.&#34;,
 &#39;Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary Full Moon entertainment. Sadly, his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years. However, in his short career Hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories. Now, this doesn\&#39;t mean that his movies are good, but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his debut, &#34;Bleed&#34;, Hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in Shaun (Danny Wolske), it seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after many sad events. Until on a party with Shaun\&#39;s friends, they tell her that they created a &#34;club&#34; where members have to kill somebody to enter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously they are joking, but Maddy wants desperately to fit in, that she actually murders someone. After that event, someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the &#34;club&#34; one by one. it is up to Maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer, including her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon\&#39;s performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton didn\&#39;t develop the whole story a little bit better. The movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens &amp; Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. Also, there is lots of nudity (both male &amp; female) and the cast is very good looking, so it is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low-budget hurts the film in the effects department, as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); nevertheless, considering the budget, the film at least looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hamilton\&#39;s more recent effort, the sexploitational venture &#34;Delta Delta Die!&#34;, is a better crafted and overall funnier film. While this one is not as bad as other better known films, it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent no-budget films. 4/10&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;d never heard of this movie, but boy was I surprised when I caught it on TV. Great cast, great acting. Excellent movie! How can a movie with William H Macy, Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland go wrong? I wonder why I never heard of it before.&#34;,
 &#39;To anyone who hasn\&#39;t seen this film yet, I have a friendly warning: don\&#39;t watch &#34;La Casa dell\&#39;Orco&#34; expecting any demons at all, because you won\&#39;t find them here. This film is not a third installment to the &#34;Demons&#34; series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever, except the fact that Lamberto Bava directed them. As a matter of fact, Michele Soavi\&#39;s &#34;The Church&#34; is also known an unofficial &#34;Demons 3&#34; and it\&#39;s a deceptive title in that case as well, so go figure. It is obvious that due to the &#34;Demons&#34; films success; they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles, even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story. Having said that, I think it\&#39;s unfair on the other hand, to say that &#34;La Casa dell\&#39;Orco&#34; is not worth the look. Honestly, the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations, I thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole. Nevertheless, I think it\&#39;s fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate Lucio Fulci\&#39;s &#34;The House by the Cemetery&#34;. Of course, that\&#39;s just a speculation I have, but I think I have my valid evidences. For instance, in both films, Paolo Marco is the man of the family, in both films, there\&#39;s an irritating little son named Bobby, in both films, the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty-something, who seems to be the only one to see that there\&#39;s something really wrong in the new house, and in both films, there\&#39;s something really, really wrong going on in the basement. I\&#39;m sorry but I can relate both films very easily and I\&#39;m not saying that as an accusation. For the contrary, my point is that those who enjoyed &#34;The House by the Cemetery&#34; are probably going to enjoy this movie as well, keeping in mind of course, that &#34;La Casa dell\&#39;Orco&#34; is far less pretentious, less scary, not nearly as atmospheric, but the formula is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &#34;La Casa dell\&#39;Orco&#34;, Charel, her husband Tom and their little son, Bobby, go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle, situated in the heart of an Italian villa called Trifiri. Leaving aside the beauty of the place, shortly after their arrival, Charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before, which is impossible, considering that she had never been to Trifiri before. Sadly, Charel can\&#39;t get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions, come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her. Tom, who is not a very patient guy to begin with, advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation. However, the woman\&#39;s visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy, suddenly turn into a living nightmare. The old nightmare from Charel\&#39;s childhood becomes real and this time, she won\&#39;t be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is expected, the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence, it is hard to fill an hour and a half. This means that &#34;La Casa dell\&#39;Orco&#34; offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character, walking around the castle for several minutes, reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else. It gets rather tedious from time to time, but overall, it\&#39;s nothing serious. Like many Italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties, this movie is pretty stylish and effective, but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments, that make the movie unforgettable in a way. For instance, the part in which Charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like I would have expected, she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac. The funniest thing however, is the fact that two minutes later, they\&#39;re a happy couple again, as if punching each other like that, was the most natural thing in the world. I know it\&#39;s silly, but I myself, found it absolutely hilarious. The ogre (which is obviously the villain of the story) looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let\&#39;s face it: a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit, it\&#39;s twice as welcomed. It reminded me of Michael Jackson in &#34;Thriller&#34;, but much more natural and human, of course. But if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that I mentioned before: the music composed by Simon Boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same, it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension. So if I have to give my final statement regarding this movie, I\&#39;m going to have to say that I can\&#39;t help loving it, including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical Italian horror movies from the late eighties, won\&#39;t be disappointed by this one. It has all the typical and always well received clichés, like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth, the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch, a creepy castle, a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility, to stay away from the infamous lands. I would say that &#34;La Casa dell\&#39;Orco&#34; deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse\&#39;s face, as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story. Take this movie for what it is and enjoy it.&#39;,
 &#34;Dragon Hunters has to be the best-looking animated film I&#39;ve ever seen. It was jaw-dropping. The film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash, their weird furry blue dog that pees fire, and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight, and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler, an impossibly immense dragon. But honestly, it doesn&#39;t even matter what the film is about. Because, it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The gravity in this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating lily pads. The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a sort of muted storybook look to it. The world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings. The monsters are visually stunning as well, like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats. Some of the plot isn&#39;t too original, like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la Of Mice and Men and never seem to be able to make it in the world; but the gorgeous graphics, some seriously sinister scenes, and emotion-evoking dialog makes this film spectacular.&#34;,
 &#39;Quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time... it\&#39;s certainly on my personal top-ten list. This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged \&#39;child\&#39; who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman\&#39;s and run into petty larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda\&#39;s chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are hilarious set pieces aplenty. In one such scene, Arthur (drunk throughout most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human \&#39;siren\&#39; (&#34;My husband has a gun!!!!). Performances by everyone involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur\&#39;s loving-yet-ruthless grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms (He took home the Oscar for this one), and Christopher Cross provides the Main Theme song (Oscar winner &#34;Best That You Can Do&#34;). It\&#39;s a shame the late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).&#39;,
 &#39;One word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.&#39;,
 &#34;I had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer,the end result was just two scenes in the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon,stop the wagon etc . So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real. (yes Doris, animals were hurt during filming) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A great western/social comment from the 50&#39;s. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for 50&#39;s youth.&#34;,
 &#34;I still haven&#39;t gotten to see all of this; it&#39;s running on cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. My main reason for being interested in it is that I&#39;m a Bill Paxton fan; he&#39;s a pretty good actor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one lame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it&#39;s hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains&#39; eight-year-old son flying T2, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top here, and it&#39;s annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but he can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don&#39;t look too closely at the machinery that drives it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it&#39;s worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it&#39;s bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you&#39;ll see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director&#39;s Guild. You can do better than this, old friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another footnote...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this had been done straight, no kids-to-the-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, it might have worked. As it is, it&#39;s just another beloved childhood joy that&#39;s been ruined.&#34;,
 &#34;This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish, so i wasn&#39;t expecting much. However, i was pleasantly surprised. At first i didn&#39;t take well to the lead girl and didn&#39;t really care if she lived or died. After a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. It&#39;s not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. I would recommend this film to everyone. If you&#39;re not sure just watch it anyway, it&#39;s only an hour and a half of your life. You&#39;re going to live for 80 years anyway.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll admit the casting in the film is REALLY strange--part of this is due to the plot, but I still had a bit of trouble believing Pierce Brosnan playing this lead (though he really did a pretty good job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. He was, in fact, so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks--even though he was not a mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked! The movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting and settings were great and I really liked the film (once I suspended disbelief about Brosnan). It didn&#39;t get widespread distribution--probably because it was pretty cerebral--not a Bond film nor a romance--just a really odd film about a remarkable man.&#34;,
 &#39;Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like &#34;Tarzan&#34; and &#34;The Emperor\&#39;s New Groove&#34; have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney\&#39;s past and into new, uncharted territory. &#34;Atlantis&#34; is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney\&#39;s animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it\&#39;s so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; et al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you\&#39;re unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron\&#39;s &#34;Titanic&#34;. Both films feature a boat in some manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let\&#39;s talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clichéd Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I was expecting. By film\&#39;s end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There\&#39;s various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it\&#39;s just not in the ballpark of, say, &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; (A good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn\&#39;t take a genius to do the maths \x96 a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clichés, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale \x96 need I go on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know why this got to anyone \x96 I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end it\&#39;s those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn\&#39;t dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent &#34;Titan A.E.&#34; down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, &#34;Nadia&#34;, for the film\&#39;s overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can\&#39;t comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it\&#39;s an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don\&#39;t like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film \x96 after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.&#39;,
 &#34;Vampires Vs. Zombies wasn&#39;t the original title. It was actually... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Getting Hit by Cars: Special Guest appearances by Bob the Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog, Random Woman with special powers and the Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the Box: Warning: No Plot- only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, I love bad movies. I love Vampires. I love Zombies. Hell, I even enjoy the lesbians. This movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, horrendous (I mean REALLY BAD) dialogue, and random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything (or do they... I didn&#39;t know what in the world was going on). Oh, and I can&#39;t forget the green oatmeal &#39;Zombies&#39; in latex gloves (yes, the film makers were so cheap they couldn&#39;t even cover their Zombies hands in oatmeal and paint). Any way, the result was this excruciatingly BAD film, if you could even call it that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was the end supposed to not make sense? The Vampire was really Nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the Vampires at all... you really couldn&#39;t call any of the girls vampires. Whatever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t ever rent or buy this movie. If you are REALLY curious... okay, I&#39;ll understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies won&#39;t be able to stand this one. It should be number 1 on the bottom 100.&#34;,
 &#34;Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box-office, and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies, mafia score-settling and World War II battles, Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It&#39;s an oddly static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors. I couldn&#39;t help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, on the basis of Z (the Lambrakis assassination) and L&#39;aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).&#34;,
 &#34;Two warring shop workers in a leather-goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box-number aliases. Within this simple idea and an everyday setting, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never lets up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and in-jokes. Although wrongly eclipsed by Stewart&#39;s big films of 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith) this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films.&#34;,
 &#34;A woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her son&#39;s friend and handy man. In a slightly twisted story, the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself. The twisted part? The handy man is also her daughter&#39;s on and off love interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if this wasn&#39;t strange enough, the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out, she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though you may think badly of this woman, the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light. Beautifully played by Anne Reid, this character has dimension and portrays great emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#34;,
 &#34;I first saw this mini-series a number of years ago on British television and was immediately captivated by the story. This rather surprised me as I am not a great fan of either &#39;Jane Eyre&#39; or &#39;Wuthering Heights&#39;; I consider the heroine of the former to be a self-righteous bore, and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&#39;, like the aforementioned works, is also somewhat depressing in parts. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Helen&#39;s escape, the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of the womenfolk in the Markham household. At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate Helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect. She runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but, as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (in spite of that terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film. Tara is dignified and aloof while, at the same time, allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves IS the depraved, yet curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing that part. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert&#39;s indulgent mother, as does the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the Good Things in Life. Finally, I could watch this film for Toby Stephens alone; he is so good-looking,rugged, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way). I am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which I felt both interfered with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing. Other people, who have watched this film with me, also had problems with this, and I found I had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film. Not only did I puchase the video (a rare occurrence), but it led me to buy Anne Bronte&#39;s superb novel. Naturally, this was better than the film, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;Vincente Minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history... He was among the first Hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color, motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;American in Paris\&#39; is the story of an ex-GI who remains in France after the war to study and paint... He falls in love with a charming gamine Lise Bourvier... Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself... The whole movie brings a touch of French elegance where technique, artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of Leslie Caron in her screen debut... She is like a diamond, a touch of class... George Guetary describes his fiancée ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles, sweet and shy, vivacious and modern, graceful and awesome... The number leads to an unpretentious bistro, where Kelly and his very good friends in Paris share a gentle parody of Viennese waltzes... Later Kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him \&#39;I Got Rhythm,\&#39; and at the massive jazz nightclub Kelly spots the girl of his dreams... He is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes, and only one clear thing is in his mind, to pull Lize onto the dance floor and sing to her: &#34;It\&#39;s very clear, Our love is here to stay.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the joyful \&#39;Tra-La-La,\&#39; Kelly provides humor, wit and talent all around Oscar Levant\&#39;s room ,and even on the top of his brown piano... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he meets his pretty Cinderella along the Seine river, Kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with Caron... He expresses all his emotions with \&#39;Our Love Is Here to Stay.\&#39; The piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft, blue smoky light... They start an enchanting dance-duet juxtaposing differing elements... Caron dances with her head on his shoulder, then tries to run away in a fluid way... They move backward, away from each other, then pause to rush toward each other, for a little kiss, and a warm hug...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story... In one, Georges Guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage... In another, Oscar Levant imagines himself conducting a concert, and playing not only a piano recital, but the other instruments as well... He even applauds to himself as members of the audience...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure, a breakthrough in taste, direction and design... It is a blaze of love, fury and vividness... It is Kelly\&#39;s major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about Paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of France\&#39;s most Impressionist painters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number starts at the Beaux Arts Ball after Kelly finds himself separated from Lise, and begins a sketch with a black crayon... It gathers the important parts of the film\&#39;s story through a constantly changing locations, all in the style of the painters who have influenced Jerry... The tour, richly attractive and superbly atmospheric, includes the Place De la Concorde Fountain, the Madeleine flower market, the Place De l\&#39;Opéra, to his Rendez-Vous at Montmartre, with the cancan dancers in a representation of Lautrec\&#39;s Moulin Rouge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self... Caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one-shouldered white gown... In one of the film\&#39;s most famous lines, Kelly asks her: \&#39;That\&#39;s quite a dress you almost have on. What holds it up?&#34; Nina, cleverly replies, &#34;modesty!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;An American in Paris\&#39; garnered six Oscars, including an honorary award to Gene Kelly... The film gave us a wealth of memories to take home...&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sure that not many people outside of Australia have ever heard of the legend of Ned Kelly. I once saw a documentary about the man, but that&#39;s the only time I once saw or heard anything about him. And I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. No-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie tells the story of Ned Kelly&#39;s life. The Irish immigrant has lived in north-west Victoria all his life, but has never been very welcome by the authorities. The police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family. When Kelly is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men. They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. All this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are outlawed. Finally they take over a pub in Glenrowan, where they have a party with all the visitors, waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up. But the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false. I guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of Robin Hood, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief. I really couldn&#39;t tell you which of them is right, perhaps both are, but what I can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was a nice addition to the documentary I once saw and I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are all actors who are pretty well known, but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.5/10&#34;,
 &#34;THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but, sadly, the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it&#39;s all merely in her mind and... well, you can probably see where this all is going. You will have figured out what&#39;s going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done better, too). To add to the movie&#39;s myriad transgressions, most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband&#39;s arms. So what did she see??? I guess we&#39;ll never know.&#34;,
 &#39;I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now! BURNING PARADISE doesn\&#39;t contain the flat humor most HK movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some &#34;intelligent&#34; space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me). There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one(which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! But mind, there\&#39;s also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical (notice: the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!). Yep, it\&#39;s not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film, it\&#39;s Ringo Lam! And I\&#39;m sure as hell going to check out more from this director! Ace.&#39;,
 &#34;Exceedingly complicated and drab. I&#39;m a bright guy, but this was just too much for a tired brain. It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing. Probably better for the US market. GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the sand dunes are pretty. The nail pulling is nasty. The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery. The cricket is good to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this, despite it being over 2 hours long. Thank heavens they shortened it. Admittedly we don&#39;t get to the pictures much, but the last film we saw, Walk the Line, was 10 times better and I don&#39;t really like Johnny Cash. My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there&#39;s that.....am I nearly there yet ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about now&#34;,
 &#39;John Carpenter\&#39;s career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication. His excuse is that he only produced it. Jon Bon Jovi looks like a girl. In fact, Bon Jovi and the two Vampire girls, Natasha Wagner and Arly Jover probably all fit in the same clothes. In short, it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way. Bon Jovi has the most charisma. At least he looks happy when he is smiling. The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints. At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss, but stop. Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires. At one point, Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act. It would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof, and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched Arly Jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening. As far as gore is concerned, a few heads are ripped off, and the blood spurts profusely. These scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny, and there is no &#34;horror&#34; pay-off from the scene. All you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of &#34;Wow, that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls. I wonder who has to clean it up.&#34; Throughout the movie, these Vampire Hunters who are obviously trying to kill Arly Jover (the top vampire in the world??) keep reaching out to her. At one point, Bon Jovi goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow (and has done so on other occasions), he says &#34;I am not trying to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. I want to get to know you.&#34; HUH?? Of course, the dumb vampire Arly jumps out to say hello and Bon Jovi sticks her again with another impaling device. &#34;Why Can\&#39;t We Be Friends&#34; the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie. Aside from all of the other silly moments, there is a transfusion sequence when Natasha Wagner has all her Vampire blood removed, and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion. I guess Blood Type is not important? Anyhow, all her Vampire blood is removed. Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him, he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also. Of course, as the vampire blood is transfused into him, none of his healthy blood is removed. So apparently Bon Jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body. And just like the first VAMPIRES, this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect.&#39;,
 &#34;If this could be rated a 0, it would be. From the atrocious wooden acting to the dull, plodding pace, the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers, this is a disaster of a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is predictable, as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence. From a boring, unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation, watch one of the Ilsa films. At least they&#39;re unapologetic and up-front about what they&#39;re trying to do. How something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not scary, it&#39;s not interesting, and above all it&#39;s not arousing in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence, and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even Elvira&#39;s cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is. Avoid it at all costs.&#34;,
 &#39;It was a saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on TV. I had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema. Boy was i mistaken. Words cannot describe how funny this film is, starring the creators of South Park, who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny. I taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time, i have seen it 7 times!!. Im obsessed with it, and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie. A MUST SEE, THIS IS MY #1 COMEDY OF ALL TIME&#39;,
 &#34;I am Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First off I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. However the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without any intent to harm her at all. He loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about. The movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while Sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing. The reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck. My father was a landscaper. The items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work. My recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt, it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie (at least the Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park portion) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is, that if the director would have interviewed any of Sharon&#39;s friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what I have posted here.&#34;,
 &#34;Just a warning... This is the worst movie I have seen in years... I couldn&#39;t watch it to the end... It is a pure waste of time... I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn&#39;t be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are searching for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around inside the building, but still they are whispering so that Snipes doesn&#39;t suspect a thing.&#34;,
 &#34;Sudden Impact is the 4th of the Dirty Harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don&#39;t really degrade in quality from one film to the next. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harry&#39;s always on the job it seems. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. As the first of the Dirty Harry films to be made in the 80&#39;s, Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70&#39;s feel that characterizes the first three films. This doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s quality is any less. Bottom Line: Brimming with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.&#34;,
 &#34;Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it&#39;s hopeless to help her patients. A young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and &#39;House of Games&#39; may very well be the best con movie I&#39;ve seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that&#39;s full of snappy dialogue, great one-liners, and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end. Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in utter control of it&#39;s audience; and we are loving the con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** out of ****&#34;,
 &#34;This is a horrid disaster of a film. From beginning to end, it&#39;s filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson&#39;s character at his peak or Streisand&#39;s character struggling. The first should be seen in decline and the second rising. The final Streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly. The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. Had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout. The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions.&#34;,
 &#39;The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981\&#39;s ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you\&#39;re in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who &#34;races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he\&#39;s his own boss.&#34; Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father\&#39;s birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur\&#39;s acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur\&#39;s behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda\&#39;s father. Stephen Elliott as Susan\&#39;s father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur\&#39;s demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.&#39;,
 &#34;Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I won&#39;t give it away, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of Miyazaki&#39;s three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you may want to check out Howl&#39;s Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA. Enjoy, Piper A&#34;,
 &#39;Have never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone. To me, &#34;I Married an Angel&#34; is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo\&#39;s more celebrated outings. The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical, the script is by the reliable Anita Loos (&#34;San Francisco,&#34; &#34;The Women,&#34; &#34;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,&#34; etc.), the Rodgers and Hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by MacDonald-Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner for scoring &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;), and best of all, the &#34;singing sweethearts&#34; look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings. Try to show &#34;Rose Marie&#34; or &#34;Sweethearts&#34; to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still, but this offbeat, fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain.&#39;,
 &#34;I enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate; from reading other comments here, I suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full-size screen in the cinema, in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky enough to have that experience, borne up on ripples of laughter from all around, and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it is as a comedy that it shines, if it shines anywhere at all. The music is nothing special -- in fact, I hadn&#39;t realised it *was* a musical, and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into half-spoken lyric -- but I do have to admit that the half-threat, half-promise of &#39;Oh, what I&#39;ll do...&#39; has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time, as it&#39;s still going round and round in my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot, such as it is, largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous Francesca, a sixteenth-century portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and fur-coat. Her idea on the sanctity of marriage don&#39;t quite jibe with those of her distant descendant, the Countess Angelina, and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the Production Code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her much-delayed marriage-bed with the right man...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The romance is scarcely earth-shattering, and in fact the first few scenes, played pretty well straight, verge on the tedious. But where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows. The impudence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr&#39;s courtship of Betty Grable&#39;s married Angelina is equalled only by Betty-Grable-as-Francesca&#39;s pursuit of him in turn, culminating in complete role-reversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she -- literally -- sweeps him off his feet. This is probably the comic climax of the plot, although the consequences of the Colonel&#39;s understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two &#39;acts&#39; of the operetta-structure, and the spectacle of Fairbanks&#39; blissful, bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters, wisely gets almost all the (limited) singing opportunities, and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned. But in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads; Fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose set-up and humour is worthy of the silent screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is too uneven in style to be a classic, varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium. But at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed, and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up. Out of tune with its times, it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences -- but, on this showing, really didn&#39;t deserve to be disowned by both Grable and Preminger, the (uncredited) director. This is no masterpiece, but a thoroughly entertaining minor work, and I for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home.&#34;,
 &#34;While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I don&#39;t hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. As a consequence of that, I haven&#39;t seen many of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I&#39;ll have to say that&#39;s a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn&#39;t the best place for me to start. It&#39;s not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it&#39;s the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo &#39;The Killer Wore Gloves&#39;. I haven&#39;t seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality wasn&#39;t one of his strong points. There&#39;s not a lot of good things I can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn&#39;t worth waiting for. I certainly don&#39;t recommend it!&#34;,
 &#39;ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be honest and confess that I wasn`t too taken by the movie since I`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but I will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features Miranda Richardson , Anna Friel , Richard E Grant , Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs . The costume design as you can expect is also excellent &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . You really do have to worry if BBC schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing&#39;,
 &#39;I have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the &#34;supporting supporting actors&#34; did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD: The escape from the ape city was terrible. The characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape. Plus, what escape route leads through everybody\&#39;s bedroom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was pared down to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#34;I remember watching this film back in 86&#39; when it first came out &amp; what an awful film. The acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind. I think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion &amp; i was not tired that i remember. Please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining. It&#39;s just a pity i couldn&#39;t give it a zero or a negative score. I wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor. If i remember right i sat &amp; watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with &amp; the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was.&#34;,
 &#34;Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven. David Hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like Last House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that - worth a look.&#34;,
 &#39;Revolt of the Zombies is BAD. There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is dull, lifeless, poorly acted, and poorly scripted. I\&#39;ve often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through &#34;zombification&#34;. One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. Once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. That\&#39;s it. That\&#39;s the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most of the movie, I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead. He looked so familiar. I had plenty of time to think this over. Nothing was happening in the movie. Just before the &#34;zombies revolted&#34;, it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas. This is how I &#34;entertained&#34; myself throughout most of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m just glad I didn\&#39;t buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and it\&#39;s a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. For what it\&#39;s worth, I\&#39;ll give it a 2/10. (I won\&#39;t go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I\&#39;ve seen worse.)&#39;,
 &#39;There were good performances by Robin Williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought Sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death: a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos. I expect most retail workers want a break from the customers.&#39;,
 &#34;I think &#39;Blackadder the Third&#39; is the best one of the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actuelly all the episodes are funny, personally i really like the episode with the &#39;French invasion&#39;, but the one with the superstitious actors, in &#39;MACBETH&#39; is also really funny, the way Rowan keeps playing on with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actors: &#39;Never say that again, always call it the Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, So you want me to say the Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of Rowan and i have the majority of his work, but i think he did the series of Blackadder especially good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Hope Rowan is going to continue his great style, but i think we can count on him, because he is already working on a Bean 2 Movie, that will be out this year, i can&#39;t wait...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Give this 3rd Blackadder a 9 out of 10 Rating.&#34;,
 &#34;Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon&#39;s Movie Madness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The movie is poor, even by Lampoon&#39;s typical standards. 2. It&#39;s not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after I finished watching it, I began wondering why on earth it&#39;s called &#39;National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,&#39; and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers &#39;An American Guy Goes to the Movies.&#39; How lame. He isn&#39;t American, and he doesn&#39;t go to movies. None of the characters in Lampoon&#39;s so-called &#39;satire&#39; are funny, and none go see movies, which causes a bit of a problem. I had hoped it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it isn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was National Lampoon&#39;s first film after Animal House, although you couldn&#39;t tell it from the quality of film. Poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it induces headaches \x96 not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed \x96 and this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles -- probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83. &#39;Hmm, Movie Madness \x96 I&#39;ve never heard of this movie before! Let&#39;s rent it!&#39; And then, the realization: &#39;Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shelved by MGM/UA, never to be released into theaters or DVD; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade, which is just about the only place you&#39;ll manage to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s split up into three stories \x96 a parody of self-enlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality/cop-buddy films (I guess). The first segment stars Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff. I&#39;m not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift. Until the sex scene popped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter (don&#39;t ask) who decides to become Queen of the Margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only funny line in the movie: &#39;Only I can make love with my son!&#39; If you think that doesn&#39;t sound very funny, you&#39;re right \x96 it&#39;s not. And just imagine \x96 it&#39;s the highlight of this film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part III is about a cop who chases down a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy. It does contain one funny scene but it&#39;s extremely over-acted \x96 only Lloyd really exhibits any humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal. The part where he&#39;s choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold, at least, evoked a chuckle or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a shame to watch such a cast of semi-famous names resort to low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe that they&#39;re being very ironic and clever by spoofing so-called stereotypes \x96 the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction, favoring the standard T &amp; A instead of plot; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It&#39;s easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie isn&#39;t funny, as I said before. I laughed once, at only one line, and even then it was a halfhearted one. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like National Lampoon&#39;s Vacation series (or, at least three of four installments), and their classic Animal House, but their recent slew of direct-to-video bombs such as Golf Punks (with that great comic genius Tom Arnold) provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago. It gets really old, really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to see a new film, called Gold Diggers, is being released with their &#39;stamp of approval.&#39; It&#39;s like condemning a film before it even hits theaters \x96 maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place\x85&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distributor: &#39;This movie is bad. It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval. That&#39;ll teach you not to make something so awful next time.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the death penalty. Just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s so bad that I can&#39;t even begin to explain its putrid vileness. I give up.&#34;,
 &#39;I rented this shortly after renting Ben Stein\&#39;s &#34;Expelled&#34; and thought it would interesting to compare them. Before I go further, it seems only fair that I point out the following so a reader can see if I\&#39;m prejudiced or not. I\&#39;m trying to be objective, for the record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to enjoy Maher\&#39;s HBO show now and then, though I rarely think he\&#39;s the source of the humor. I don\&#39;t really care for his stand-up either. But he makes some good points on the show now and again, and I liked Politically Incorrect, though he was still fairly politically correct (which I deem a negative because the very term sounds Orwellian or at least fascist). As for my religious views, I\&#39;ll say for simplicity\&#39;s sake that I\&#39;m a non-denom. Christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this a bad &#34;documentary&#34; for reasons that haven\&#39;t been touched on yet by many reviewers--though the ones mentioned are valid too. The reason it\&#39;s not convincing isn\&#39;t just that he argues the main point without letting others talk (and his point boils down to nothing logical either, it\&#39;s just &#34;come on, really?&#34; which isn\&#39;t a point, just a question. Try David Hume if you want a decent argument.). The reason this isn\&#39;t convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter. I saw this about 2 months ago and I only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn\&#39;t a clergyman. There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with Masters or Doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring, particularly in the fields of History, Anthropology or a host of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one compares this to Ben Stein\&#39;s &#34;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&#34; he\&#39;ll find that Stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors, professionals, clergy, etc. He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds. He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education. Maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this. Instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century\&#39;s secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio-political power!!!! (it\&#39;s in the bonus features where he\&#39;s standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think.) This is a true Orwellian head-trip. He blames Christianity in particular on many pointless deaths--which has had its share, though far smaller than most!!--without even including a basic view of the evidence. Perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism\&#39;s miserable record of the 20th Century ALONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or &#34;average&#34; practitioner. He picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd. How difficult is that? How does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule? It does not. Wow, so people in cults think outside of the norm? How enlightening to know this. Great work Maher! Again, it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of &#34;patriotic duty&#34; that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond all that, he\&#39;s just not that funny here. Some of the clips that are overlaid in &#34;clever&#34; out of context/irreverent ways might garner a laugh, but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming, much less convincing. He spends most of his time bashing Christians, spouting inaccuracies, and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn\&#39;t allow to really answer his questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves. He touches on almost none of these. I get the feeling that I could\&#39;ve responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed, but the whole thing reeks of deck-stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out.&#39;,
 &#39;I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he\&#39;s become known for in the past decade. As much as the film is G-rated, it\&#39;s pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. It\&#39;s also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either &#34;good&#34; or &#34;evil&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80\&#39;s with \&#39;Blue Velvet\&#39; and \&#39;The Elephant Man\&#39;. Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as \&#39;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\&#39; and \&#39;Lost Highway\&#39; but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film \&#39;Mulholland Drive\&#39;, considering the high praise it\&#39;s received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;Straight Story\&#39; is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I\&#39;ve ever seen. It\&#39;s a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.&#39;,
 &#39;Frankly I don\&#39;t understand why this movie has been such a big &#34;flop&#34; in publicity. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and &#34;touch&#34; since &#34;Basic instinct&#34;. I voted this film 10 and I tell you why: Game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged. She is &#34;screwing your brain&#34; as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don\&#39;t be quite sure who is the real villain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better had Sharon Stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. Her B-rate &#34;assistants&#34; are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap Hollywood so readily distributes these days. The plot is great, it\&#39;s easy to see technically, you don\&#39;t snore in the half way through the film and most important -the heath is on.&#39;,
 &#34;This is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain. It is 75% a rehash of The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially confused as I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) may have been a different Lacey, but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film. Fans will immediately note that they are not the same person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials, head to the house, and, sure enough, it&#39;s the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the movie shift to a rerunning of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original. Notably, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Sadly, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there. Why rerun this film? Did they find the footage in the trash? What was the purpose? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;ll never know and, despite the psychologist telling Annie she is cured, we all know the bogeyman will never die.&#34;,
 &#39;Over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - Check! Weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - Check! Mobile suits based on angels - Check!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK - its a Gundam series. This one, Gundam Wing, has good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although is still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy, the series main character). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcherer, becomes more and more human, while still remaining in-character. And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelance, and command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn\&#39;t used to its full potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc - are ones that resonate even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the &#34;War on Terrorism&#34; and all. But its exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writing in the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor, which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of eye-candy, which is what this one has in bucketloads, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (No not the tampons you idiot!) is wells designed, and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad, because better animation would\&#39;ve had better explosions). But who cares?! Stuff explodes, and thats all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short though, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes, you\&#39;ve missed out on a lot. The poor writing can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animation makes you go &#34;WTF?!?!&#34; But this is made up for in its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration that one expects of such Japenese animations.&#39;,
 &#34;Attractive Marjorie(Farrah Fawcett)lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker. She is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe(James Russo), the attacker forces his way into Marjorie&#39;s home and subjects her to humiliating terror. Bruised and bloody, Marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker, knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat. Hog tied and battered himself, Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie&#39;s roommates(Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. There is almost a hint of mercy, but it is not coming from Marjorie. Should she continue to render her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and rough language makes for an R rating. Fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.&#34;,
 &#34;This film was so amateurish I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It is shot on VIDEO! NOT film! I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70&#39;s, when late night networks showed movie of the week &#39;horror flicks&#39; shot in......video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying it a compliment. Some of the actors give it their best shot. Michael Des Barres does okay with what he is given to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. I can&#39;t say that it is pleasant to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. I can&#39;t fault her for someone else&#39;s poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. Her little girl voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. She is certainly ageless and exotic, but she&#39;s outside her range with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought. Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Rosanna Arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch. But that is not saying much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the worst film I have seen in years.&#34;,
 &#39;The special effects of this movie are, especially for its time, laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way that you can\&#39;t deny their terrible existance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting redefines the term &#34;terrible overacting&#34; at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine &#34;bad&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***spoilers***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charm in this movie can be found in two things: First is the excellent casting of Carel &#34;Lurch&#34; Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt, who can sense where and when people will die and is always there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second are original finds, the combination SF-Western is obviously original, if terrible, but other finds are more original, like the gunman Zack Stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots (though his acting falls short here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal...don\&#39;t see this movie, except if you love that ol\&#39; hunk-o-brutal Carel Struycken, as any self-respecting Dutchman should.&#39;,
 &#39;The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye. Jean Simmons is quite good, and Trevor Howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero.&#39;,
 &#34;I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light. My family is from the southeast region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up around talk like these folks did. The Cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are well educated, proud people and don&#39;t sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did. All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please have the actors study the language, live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it&#39;s a much more enjoyable movie!&#34;,
 &#39;(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I don\&#39;t know Peter Mattei from Adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests, &#34;Love in the Time of Money&#34; is a &#34;good start&#34;. A classy shoot with whimsical music box style music, this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C...etc...and back again ending with persons A &amp; B in carousel fashion. The film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client. The downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received. I watched the behemoth &#34;Angels in America&#34; last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound. Use caution. I may be the only person who really liked this flick. (B)&#39;,
 &#39;In the first 20 minutes, every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director. There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically-tortured NTSB board member played by [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of a crash victim; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics. Most of this TV plane wasn\&#39;t even burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminded me of the scene in &#34;Air Force One&#34; where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it\&#39;s made of inch-thick steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who is more accepting than I, was commenting on technical flaws. What had me stunned was how this POS could ever get made. Are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can\&#39;t even recognize them? Somebody read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million bucks making this real. I wish I was the guy\&#39;s next appointment. I have title to a wonderful bridge in New York that I\&#39;d sell cheap.&#39;,
 &#34;I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was amusing at times, but really, it wasn&#39;t very funny at all. If I&#39;d been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who&#39;s less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. He&#39;s absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare it to The Fountainhead.&#34;,
 &#34;This show has a few clichés and a few over the top, Dawson&#39;s Creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talking about way back when life made sense?), but overall it seems like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. I just hope every episode doesn&#39;t turn out to be life-altering like the first, that would just be too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of.&#34;,
 &#39;My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It\&#39;s not that the movie is terrible, it\&#39;s just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While I\&#39;ve been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I\&#39;m not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I\&#39;m coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, &#34;light&#34; moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I\&#39;m convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it.&#39;,
 &#39;EARTH is a must see for children and adults. My son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger to disappear. Exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary offers many exceptional pictures that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. The director did a great job here that gets high respect. Nothing can stop me and my family to give EARTH the highest rate. I hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel.&#39;,
 &#34;To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too.. To say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service, if you want to see something that is totally execrable, you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching &#39;sickle&#39;, that is soo mind numbingly awful, its actually good,(several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though. Any road up, I enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet, just don&#39;t expect anything along the lines of &#39;jurassic park,the lost world&#39; or &#39;apocalypto&#39;.&#34;,
 &#39;Loopy, but shrewd and formidable mob boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) gets released from a mental hospital. Several of Vic\&#39;s fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman &#34;Brass Balls&#34; Ben London (a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by Gabriel Byrne), the smarmy Jake Parker (a perfectly smug Kyle MacLachlan), and vicious rival &#34;Wacky&#34; Jacky Jackson (a neat turn by Burt Reynolds) all try to bump Vic off. Meanwhile, laid-back and self-assured hit-man Mickey Holliday (nicely played with low-key confidence by Jeff Goldblum) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy. Writer/director Larry Bishop brings a supremely hip, quirky, and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal, loyalty, and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok. The bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues\&#39; gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums: Ellen Barkin as tough, sultry moll Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic\&#39;s reliable right-hand man Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic\&#39;s sweet, perky mistress Grace, Billy Drago as the slimy Wells, and Christopher Jones as brutish rub-out artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick. Popping up in nifty bits are Billy Idol as a blustery thug, Michael J. Pollard as the ill-fated Red, Joey Bishop as mortician Mr. Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a jolly chauffeur, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne\&#39;s delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka on &#34;My Way&#34; rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight. A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical. Frank Byers\&#39; slick cinematography, the outrageously nutty dialogue, Earl Rose\&#39;s jazzy cocktail lounge score, and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio.&#39;,
 &#34;This film was absolutely...ugh i can&#39;t find the word oh wait... crap! I mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. Ram Gopal Varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for Black? Ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. What was Amitabh doing? He&#39;s destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I&#39;m telling you he&#39;s already past half his way. I mean all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who&#39;s getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks he&#39;s God and i just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save your £17.75 and spend it on something good go watch Heyy Babyy because that&#39;s just the funniest movie ever and it&#39;s number one in the charts!&#34;,
 &#39;What can I say??? This movie was so Dumb &amp; Stupid I thought it was a Psychotic DRAG Comedy - They should rename it &#34;Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!&#34; What a stupid waste of time , if you want to see(DIE DIE!!! &#34;I WANT YOUR BABY DRAG QUEEN) Jennifer Tilly being her Freaky self then just rent out one Of the &#34;Chucky&#34; movie, oh ya , &#34;The Bride Of Chucky.&#34; It\&#39;s more fun watching the Two Ugly Plastic dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly turned into the UGLY Female version of Chucky) having Squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching Daryl Hannah being pregnant , Dumb &amp; stupid; &amp; Jennifer Tilly Grinding up her Husbang in a Food Processor reminded me of my Mother trying to do House Work! OK it\&#39;s just BAD!!!&#39;,
 &#39;I think that that creator(s) of this film\&#39;s concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received. It isn\&#39;t an Oscar caliber film of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it back in 1984 (in the theatre). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t think this is (and hope it isn\&#39;t) a spoiler, but: imagine acting on your impulses. Doing the first thought that pops into your head, saying the first words on your lips... No restraint, no conscious, nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that, as intelligent adults, we know we shouldn\&#39;t actually say or do. If anything, this film only scratches the surface - It doesn\&#39;t go as far as it could go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older &#34;classics&#34; to try and cash in on today, wouldn\&#39;t it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success, for the sake of taking it to the next level? A bit further, or even to explore what the original crew didn\&#39;t, wouldn\&#39;t or couldn\&#39;t deal with 20 years ago? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s just my opinion anyway. :o)&#39;,
 &#39;Normally when I write a review for a movie online, it is for one of three reasons. Either, I have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, I feel that the public\&#39;s perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or I believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. While all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, I find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as, &#34;This is one of the best films of all time!&#34;, does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. With that being said, War of the Worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggy-backing its loathsome carcass on the multi-million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg. Many people will buy this DVD in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. This movie is not even &#34;so bad&#34; that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. Now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than I. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film (I found it as SAM\&#39;s Club for 8 bucks), I assumed that the cast would be no-names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular. Check. This is not a big deal for me, as I find a large budget and an over-reliance on big name stars and SE can diminish an otherwise decent movie. I also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score. Check again. What I did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien/battle scenes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as per IMDb\&#39;s policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. The movie opens with a lot of inane small-talk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. Seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. It is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camera-work, spliced scenes, and a LOT of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. However, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. The next 30 minutes basically go as follows: one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. They both walk back to town. These walks aren\&#39;t two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. They are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. In a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says &#34;Thank you Mary&#34; to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. I apologize for the extreme run-on sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. Characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere. The editing is mind-bogglingly bad. People actions make little sense. For instance, when the professor goes to a farmer\&#39;s house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. When the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. Nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. The entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. I have seen better high school video productions. Finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. I get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. However, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. Avoid this film at all costs.&#39;,
 &#34;I have seen just about all of Miyazaki&#39;s films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me clarify: I&#39;m really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and hearing) the movie the way it originally was.&#34;,
 &#34;The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that I&#39;ve seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him when he&#39;s out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns she&#39;s working for communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but it&#39;s not so bad that it harms the film (unlike Fuller&#39;s previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. This must be one of his best roles, but I&#39;m not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.&#34;,
 &#39;This is available on a &#34;Drive In Double Feature&#34; from Dark Sky Films, and since I just had finished up &#34;Barracuda&#34;, I watched this too. This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at necklaces from some Chinese vendor, and try on Chinese-style clothes at a shop, but then we see some Aztec dancers? And all the while, these girls are being followed by two guys, who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn\&#39;t have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town, and they finally catch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? So, in flashback, we go back to find out. And how did they know she had this coin? Hard to say, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sister\&#39;s boyfriends on a boat, and after stopped to get air in their tanks, they tow this young boy back to his home dock, only to have his grandpa come out &amp; invite the &#34;young \&#39;uns&#34; up for herbal tea with granny. But not everyone has the tea, Todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls, and then when they\&#39;re away from it, the boat blows up, and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems as though these &#34;kindly folk&#34; raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell, and serve it herbal tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the girls and Todd did leave the island, but now, they\&#39;re returning, escorted by their captors, and they\&#39;re there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was BEFORE. There also seems to be someone else on the island, and the thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there\&#39;s only three, it doesn\&#39;t take long. And there\&#39;s even a sort of happy ending, which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues, and combined with no acting ability they\&#39;re borderline hilarious. The hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandpa is Hank Worden, who appeared in many films and TV shows. The action is confusing, the locales are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what the hell IS this? I\&#39;m not sure, but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.&#39;,
 &#39;Seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring. I think it\&#39;s seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new. It\&#39;s pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more \&#39;hip\&#39; and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of it really worked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he wasn\&#39;t really a good presenter. I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. His presence wasn\&#39;t really as \&#39;big\&#39; as for instance Billy Crystal\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. Not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I can\&#39;t remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? I don\&#39;t think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, with the exception of &#34;Million Dollar Baby&#34; and &#34;The Passion of the Christ&#34; maybe. Sure I don\&#39;t agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I don\&#39;t like Robert Richardson\&#39;s work, he really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone\&#39;s work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more. Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But oh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince said any of the nominees names right at once? And were is Sean Penn\&#39;s sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy &#34;I hope they missed&#34; Irons were the best presenters of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#39;,
 &#39;Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous &#34;I Shot Andy Warhol&#34; and &#34;American Psycho&#34; were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although &#34;The Notorious Bettie Page&#34; is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&amp;W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed &#34;Just Looking&#34; in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?&#39;,
 &#39;I had some reservations about this movie, I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great &#34;dad&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.&#39;,
 &#39;I remember Casper comic books, but don\&#39;t remember any cartoons. Maybe they weren\&#39;t memorable; I don\&#39;t know but at my advanced age, here I am watching this very early Casper animated short yesterday. Afterward, I was shocked to read the user-comments here. Did people miss the ending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to learn all over again that Casper isn\&#39;t like the other ghosts, who like to go out each night and scare the c--p out of everyone. &#34;He sees no future in that,&#34; according to the narrator here. Instead, one night he goes out to the rural section of town, inadvertently scares some animals and can\&#39;t find any friends. It brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him. The two become buddies but soon, the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have all mentioned what happens, so I\&#39;ll touch on that, too. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is in tears for losing &#34;the only friend I ever had.&#34; But, nobody mentions the happy ending to this story. &#34;Ferdie&#34; the fox becomes a spirit-figure like Casper, jumps on his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments &#34;they lived happily ever after.&#34; Both characters look overjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so sad about that? This is a nice story with a nice, happy ending.&#39;,
 &#34;What a terrible film. It sucked. It was terrible. I don&#39;t know what to say about this film but DinoCrap, which I stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh.. It&#39;s not Roger Corman that I hate, it&#39;s this god-awful movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. Which is another thing, the CGI sucked out loud; I hate this movie dreadfully. This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the gayest B-Movie too. It&#39;s-it&#39;s--- DINOCRAP! I&#39;m sorry, I must have offended some nerds in these moments. It&#39;s just an awful movie... 0/1,000&#34;,
 &#39;I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. However, I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made a full movie, and a rather weak one at that.&#39;,
 &#39;Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the full-feature movie-version of &#34;Earth&#34; by DisneyNature. I guess, like the auto manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really do care about the planet, I don\&#39;t know, but I don\&#39;t think it warrants a special unit with the word &#34;nature&#34; in it. I do know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about Disney? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Preceded by a half-dozen Disney movie trailers, rife with Disney cliché (&#34;circle of life&#34;, &#34;falling with style&#34;), over-dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims &#34;40% new footage&#34;). I was even starting to think that James Earl Jones narration is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman doing every Warner Brothers narrative starts to wear thin. I really think that Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what is Disney\&#39;s obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals? There were a half-dozen such scenes, complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out. I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents. I was also cognizant of how Disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change. Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it\&#39;s still a controversial subject? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature films seem to be best done by the British at the moment.&#39;,
 &#39;This movie was crap with a capital &#34;C.&#34; The opening scene showed promise. But that &#34;promise&#34; was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the wooden statue, Morty, who was rather creepy in the original film, looks plain goofy in this one. It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (And by the way, who else thinks &#34;Morty&#34; is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth? It ranks right up there with &#34;Jimmy&#34; or &#34;Fred&#34; when it comes to horror value. Or why not just name the wooden statute Henry-freakin\&#39;-Kissinger. &#34;Run, it\&#39;s Dr. Kissinger!&#34; That\&#39;d be about as scary as &#34;Morty.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there\&#39;s a scene where the &#34;hero&#34; hits his father\&#39;s tombstone with---&#34;a sledgehammer?&#34; you might guess--&#34;a two-by-four?&#34; someone might venture. No, he angrily beats his father\&#39;s tombstone with a twig---a freakin\&#39; twig. But worse than that, once the characters walk away, the tombstone actually, and inexplicably, bleeds. Oh brother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s also a Native American guy who lives with the main character\&#39;s grandparents, but apparently, does nothing except Morty-maintenance. He perpetuates creepy Morty-legends, warns those who scoff, and even fixes Morty\&#39;s arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank. But for all his respect for and tenderness toward Morty, does Morty give a rat\&#39;s hairy behind? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie drags on, and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (sort of). This film is a real yawner. Don\&#39;t rent it.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s some very clever humour in this film, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors. However, after a while it just seems an exercise in style (notwithstanding great gags such as Balasko continuing the part of Dussolier, and very good acting by all involved) and I was wondering why Blier made this film. All is revealed in the ending, when Blier, directing Claude Brasseur, gets a phone call from his dad (Bernard Blier) - from heaven, and gets the chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt. But there isn&#39;t really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it&#39;s entire running time. Some really nice scenes and sequences, however, and anyone who likes these &#39;mosntres sacrés&#39; of the French cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film.&#34;,
 &#34;I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was dam Funny! When i first time i saw it was playing on ETV(Estonian Television) And i started to like it. Too bad that that show is on bad time for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes on stupid ideas. He got these glasses which h are brown. I like it . And there&#39;s FeZ. The group Pervert. We all know what he does when his alone..... He wants to get laid badly. He even had it with his boss in one episode.His from India. And there is Michael , The stupidest guy on whole group , probably stupidest in town and his a cop! He is so stupid that i remember follows: Hyde says: Did u called cops ? - No Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off siren? He is a town playboy. Then comes Jackie , who is former girlfriend of Michael and then she&#39;s Hyde&#39;s girlfriend. Then is Eric Who&#39;s son of grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty the housewife. His one big pussy. But he loves Donna , his girlfriend with who they plan for they&#39;re marriage. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm what i forget? ah Hyde lives in a basement .&#34;,
 &#39;i\&#39;ve discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging. the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the movie and it\&#39;s women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects...and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet. the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a &#34;cult classic&#34;...however, i can\&#39;t possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this film is how bad it is. i\&#39;m embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again!&#39;,
 &#39;:Spoilers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in Love\&#39;s Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three &#34;Love&#34; movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn\&#39;t seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that\&#39;s been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke\&#39;s writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy\&#39;s death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the four movies that have been made so far I\&#39;d have to say that Love\&#39;s Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he\&#39;s got a bigger part and I hope his part isn\&#39;t so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.&#39;,
 &#34;...except for Jon Heder. This guy tanked the entire movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot sounded entertaining. A 29 year old slacker son(Heder)still lives with widowed mom (Keaton)who happens to meet a new love (Daniels). Slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl(Faris).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris but whoever casted Hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach. Heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale. At the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you&#39;re upset about the end. In the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me!&#34;,
 &#39;Get this film if at all possible. You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by \x85 &#34;The Unseen&#34;. I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach, whom I\&#39;d just viewed in &#34;The Spy Who Loved Me.&#34; I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. So: we start with a nice fresh premise. TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town, Solvang, that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. She brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (The late Karen Lamm plays Bach\&#39;s sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching Bach (Mrs. Ringo Starr) and Lamm (Mrs. Dennis Wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) Anyway \x85 Bach\&#39;s disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang, as he\&#39;s not done arguing with her. There\&#39;s a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn\&#39;t wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (Maybe to Bach\&#39;s boyfriend, because think of it \x96 where\&#39;s he gonna stay?). The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller (the late Sidney Lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. Oh no! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that company\&#39;s coming and threatening that she\&#39;d better play along. Trouble in paradise! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes, but one of the girls doesn\&#39;t feel good. Bach and Lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. Speaking of which \x85 under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. She hears him, thinks he\&#39;s come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn\&#39;t get a long enough look. After he\&#39;s left, poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor \x85 The Unseen! Lamm comes home next (Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can\&#39;t find anyone in the house. She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille \x85 attracting The Unseen again! Well, at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into Mr. Keller\&#39;s past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn\&#39;t smile much. Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. Meanwhile, Lassick has been apprised of the afternoon\&#39;s carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can\&#39;t let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst, whom I\&#39;d never seen before; it\&#39;s obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; Bach and Goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. Not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. No stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... A real treat for your collection.&#39;,
 &#34;OK, this movie was cool. I don&#39;t think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. Enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. Judgment is victory for Robot Jox.&#34;,
 &#34;Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary&#39;s Baby, in The Tenant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atmosphere is trademark Polanski - dark, brooding, unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and I am not sure whether or not it is deliberate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman&#39;s most beautiful films, doesn&#39;t quite do himself justice here. As his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting cast are great, notably Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the concierge, but others are weak and miscast. It is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However, there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. Trelkovsky&#39;s sudden (and somewhat unexplained) &#39;transformation&#39; is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, The Tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a little too languorous for its own good. There&#39;s a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film, while being very good, does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, at the end of the day, an &#39;okay&#39; Polanski movie is still better than most other &#39;good&#39; movies. Definitely worth a watch, just don&#39;t expect to be blown away.&#34;,
 &#39;Great CGI effects &amp; a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from Forrest\&#39;s service in Vietnam all the way through to the &#34;resolution&#34; with Jenny at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this film and ask yourself &#34;What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forrest seems to have made the &#34;right&#34; choices and been at the &#34;right place at the right time&#34; for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director\&#39;s vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?&#39;,
 &#39;Very different topic treated in this film. A straightforward and simple description of local Chinese customs, by looking at the daily operation of a public bath, run by the old owner and his retarded son, when older son returns home, wrongly believing his father has died. How every man in town makes his daily visit to chat, play games, discuss personal matters and get honest advice, besides the usual spa-like therapies. When old man dies, strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge, so public bath operation is not disrupted. And finally, the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along. The public bath has to be demolished, making place for a commercial complex to be constructed.&#39;,
 &#34;Not to mention easily Pierce Brosnon&#39;s best performance. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when has he really been bad? I think this film is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this movie is something very different in today&#39;s film world where every other movie has the Payback blue filter. I also love the way they used the song by Asia. Proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was making my first feature when this came out. Being that my film was a hit-man movie, I had to check out anything in the genre that was released. After seeing it, I&#39;m sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was pretty cool when my film got on the IMDb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine. How any of the others relate I have no idea, making an even more interesting coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Midnight Cowboy&#34; is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America. Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released. But be warned, its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending, something which was basically mandatory by the 80s. Still, this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film. Its a time when well-made, innovative, and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this was over by the time &#34;Star Wars&#34; was released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, &#34;Midnight Cowboy&#34; has aged quite well. Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released. The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece. The characters\&#39; backgrounds are never fully explained, but the performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, being a fan of vintage exploitation films, I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street. &#34;Midnight Cowboy&#34; is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)&#39;,
 &#39;This movie is phoniness incarnate, a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale. The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. Yanks, although the real Scotland may be just as colourful, if you ever go there don\&#39;t expect to be given much of a the chance to &#34;dance out&#34; controversies with the locals. Also, don\&#39;t attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes, but the plot is far too cheesy and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City. Maybe it wasn\&#39;t such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland would look like on LSD. Other than that I\&#39;d only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists.&#39;,
 &#34;at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this: that shots of fat people sunbathing, etc were cheap shots in a way. OK so he&#39;s doing diane arbus meets. . . whatever. . . but it wasn&#39;t long before I realized that this wasn&#39;t being done in a dehumanizing way, as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audience&#39;s: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold, so don&#39;t oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this ain&#39;t a rosy picture of the world but it&#39;s not . . . completely hopeless. anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. I wouldn&#39;t say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest, but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . .&#34;,
 &#34;I originally gave this episode a rating of two- I now wish I&#39;d thought more about it. I also wish they had negative rating options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching it, I was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish. I adore Ron Pearlman, and John Carpenter... so what went wrong?? Last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue. I think that this season Mr Carpenter managed to make something so grey-area that you can&#39;t immediately see if he is pro-choice or anti-abortion. It was only after I sat and thought about it that I realized he is very much anti-abortion- you get this most clearly in the end when the &#39;Mother&#39; shoots the baby and kills it, to the dismay of the &#39;Father&#39;, who walks off in grief, leaving the mother unharmed. But you also see it in the way the Ron P. character is treated- I hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police. Instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him (only to pay for it in the end) I don&#39;t mind someone having a strong view on something, even if it isn&#39;t something I agree in, but I do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view, rather than trying to look like they&#39;re sitting somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, political issues aside, this episode was beyond poor. The music was retro-70&#39;s and just plain didn&#39;t work. The acting (other than Ron P.) was poor. The effects were dreadful- it might have been better just to -not- show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this being said, I&#39;m glad they have the Masters of Horror- I don&#39;t mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones. Its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store- every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while. I do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from Masters- some of these people just plain don&#39;t deserve the title. (Let me stress tho- even tho I hated this episode, John Carpenter TOTALLY deserves the title. He is a master thru and thru)&#34;,
 &#34;A found tape about 3? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, spoiler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the acting made this short not scary at all, the woman seemed to have orgasms, not suffering. Some of the punishments were so ridiculous! what&#39;s shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair? If you are shooting a nonsense tape, at least make it good. The only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye, the rest of the film is really poor. To end the boredom, the supposed story about the tape being investigated, extra bullshit.&#34;,
 &#39;I was very impressed with this film. I would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns. I say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Anthony Mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one. It has that same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart film &#34;Bend Of The River.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, the story is about a man, &#34;Lin McAdam,&#34; (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest. It is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. All of those villains are interesting characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiding Stewart act out this interesting tale are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. It was a bit of a stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian (&#34;Young Bull&#34;), but you can\&#39;t have everything.&#39;,
 &#39;clara bow\&#39;s beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film. &#34;hula&#34; is not quite up to par with clara\&#39;s best films but it is still enjoyable. she dances, she rides her horse, and pursues the man that she loves. this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming (gone with the wind).the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time. if you like clara, i would reccomend &#34;hula.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;No real plot to this one, just a series of short skits acting out some VERY old jokes. I chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin. But even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it\&#39;s welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious (with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake). Still as bad as this movie is (and that\&#39;s pretty putrid), it\&#39;s a comedic gem compared to pretty much ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer &amp; Jason Friedberg (Date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans) Also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: 11 pair of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer for this film; and trailers for &#34;Beyond the Door&#34;, &#34;Dead Pit&#34;, &#34;the Farmer&#34;, &#34;obsessed Ones&#34;, &#34;Power Play&#34;, &#34;Sole Survivor&#34;, &amp; &#34;Wacky Taxi&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;The film released at the start of 2000 alongwith MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film seems to suit 70&#39;s but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywayz some classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I don&#39;t understand to laugh at his role or cry Reason: He goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of Anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole film is a joke can&#39;t explain We have Anil in a dual role(One older and younger) and Rekha playing the older&#39;s wife and Raveena the youngers We also have reject Harish while Shakti playing the son of Aruna Irani who both fight on who has the worst wig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction is outdated Music is bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort Rekha is adequate, Raveena too is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a cameo&#34;,
 &#39;OK, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid slasher movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going. We got a FBI agent that\&#39;s seen Dirty Harry one time too many. &#34;So what\&#39;s the secret....punks?&#34; We got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all. &#34;Hey man, i\&#39;m fixing the sprinklers&#34; ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there\&#39;s a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies, he gets killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere, with no cops. suddenly she\&#39;s in a church, wearing a wedding dress. i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i\&#39;ve ever seen.&#39;,
 &#39;THE BEAVER TRILOGY is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was lucky enough to catch it, along with a Q&amp;A session with director Trent Harris, at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of Trent\&#39;s website. This movie HAS to be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching for Trent\&#39;s name on the web and then buying the film from his site. He\&#39;s an incredibly nice guy to boot. Don\&#39;t get confused: The cameraman in the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having seen the TRILOGY a few times, I do have to admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version. It\&#39;s like a try-out version for the Crispin Glover &#34;Orkly Kid&#34; section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you\&#39;re a Penn fan than it being a good video. Penn is pretty funny, though, and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty B&amp;W video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably also one of Crispin Glover\&#39;s best roles and I would just love to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin\&#39; Gary. Once you see this film, you\&#39;ll never get Gary\&#39;s nervous laughter out of your head ever again.&#39;,
 &#34;this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad... hence, can i advice anyone to watch it? well, i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition (i still can&#39;t believe it won)..and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q&amp;a section..but that was also anything but interesting.. what&#39;s it about? well the first half (the worth watching one) presents three characters: a hooker, a musician and some kind of official..the first two lie about their professions..but the third is the actual liar.. the second half (do something else..don&#39;t ruin a good evening) includes some old breasts and heavy drinking.. but maybe you will see it completely different...the tiff jury did (were they drinking vodka ?)&#34;,
 &#34;Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th. Intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident, which kind of gives it an even greater appeal. Up until that morning, filmmakers Gideon and Jules Naudet had been following around a New York firefighter team, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman. Out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup, Jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, and from there a simple documentary was no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero, as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster. Without hesitation, Naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it&#39;s entire support crumbles around them. The raw fear of an unknown, impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside. Nearly as memorable is older brother Gideon&#39;s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed. By the time we get to see the second tower collapse, as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris, we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event, though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event; in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage, even if it cost them their own safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After viewing 9/11, and seeing that it came out in 2002, I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stone&#39;s recent rendition, the big budgeted World Trade Center. Many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble, and although I enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it brought, 9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete. Not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day, but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again.&#34;,
 &#39;THE CAT O\&#39;NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Cromoscope)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Mono&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(35mm and 70mm release prints)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O\&#39;NINE TAILS as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was \&#39;nine times more suspenseful\&#39; than &#34;Bird&#34; - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento\&#39;s dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus\&#39; romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer\&#39;s devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. It\&#39;s no surprise that &#34;Cat&#34; failed to emulate the runaway success of &#34;Bird&#34; when released in 1971.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(English version)&#39;,
 &#34;I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one. I think it was the latter. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small, yet important details. One of the first things I noticed was, during Winston&#39;s day to day life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. One of the most important parts of the book, was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions. In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it begs the question, what&#39;s the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The large inaccuracies were far more disturbing, however. First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent, yet crude philosophy. In the movie, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when directed with its facism, but if that&#39;s all you get out of Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. When O&#39;Brien is picking at Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love, he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing. In the end, (careful SPOILER ahead) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this, or the actual power behind the philosophy. I am in no way saying that the Big Brother&#39;s philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was awful, no connection whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And where was O&#39;Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons thoughts about O&#39;Brien BEFORE he made contact with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption: because its impossible NOT to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think this movie was watchable if it was under two hours? At the very least, the movie demands 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections. Anything less is just pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you loved the book, and I mean TRULY adored it, you will not approve of this movie, and chances are, you already knew you wouldn&#39;t. Because the book is unfilmable, and this movie just proves how impossible it is cram something decent into a small reel of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars out of ten&#34;,
 &#39;A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on. Now, he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark slasher film with an unexceptional premise. Bringing it up a notch are a few good performances, some rather creative death scenes, plenty of excitement &amp; scares, some humor and an original ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use.&#39;,
 &#34;If you&#39;re amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation, you&#39;ll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman enters a small café. The scene looks ordinary, but the counterman, customers, and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song , dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures. The customers, at first immobile, at intervals chime in (badly but gamely) with phrases from the song, read from slips of paper in their palms. On and off they jump up and dance (awkwardly but earnestly) in choreographed motions, like backup singers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why??? the woman wonders. The answer is revealed as the soloist&#39;s jacket opens and she sees what&#39;s strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#39;t catch the song&#39;s (probably ironical) lyrics, the situation-perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle... I&#39;d love to see it again!&#34;,
 &#34;This movie was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#39;t develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly. It was a definite sleeper. You&#39;d expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but D-Wars surprises you with even a let down in that department. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick. And I seriously mean that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!! Please, whatever you do people, don&#39;t waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.&#34;,
 &#39;Hilarious, laugh out loud moments ... and yet not a comedy. I particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the &#34;filthy bum&#34; who then shouts after them in anger &#34;you filthy bums&#34;, I mean wow, someone\&#39;s online degree in literature is paying off! The worst script imaginable, with plot introductions in an instant, ridiculous movement in the story, ZERO character development (even between the characters who meet .. it\&#39;s as if they all have known and trusted each other for years) dodgy voice over with added echo effects, and plot holes.. oh God are there plot holes!! To be honest I write this not even having watched the entire thing, but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we\&#39;ve got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of ... well ... use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence!&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Demons III: The Ogre&#34; is not related pre-sequel are on &#34;The Demons&#34; and &#34;The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic.&#34;Demons III: The Ogre&#34; is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. I am very confuse about the writer is &#34;Demons III: The Ogre&#34; (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demon\&#39;s egg from Spider\&#39;s web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). I am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. I Bought The special DVD box called &#34;Demons&#34; on the 3 different movies called &#34;Demons III: The Ogre&#34;, &#34;The Other Hell&#34;, and &#34;Black Demons&#34; don\&#39;t have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like &#34;Halloween III&#34; don\&#39;t have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I am very confused. I really love &#34;The Demons&#34; and &#34;The Demons 2 are better the boring stupid &#34;Demons III: The Ogre&#34; is not part for &#34;The Demons&#34; and &#34;The Demons 2&#34; are same demons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre&#39;,

 &#34;This is my first comment on IMDb website, and the reason I&#39;m writing it is that we&#39;re talking about ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER! &#39;Ne goryuy!&#39; will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you&#39;re not a fan yet!) with Georgian choir singing tradition, and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it:) What I like a lot about this film is that actors in the non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character. The film is starring Vahtang Kikabidze (who is great), but you will remember every single face around him in the film. You will find yourself quoting their lines, that have become household names for so many Russian-speaking people. A film to live with. Simple, yet deep, you will want to watch it again and again.&#34;,
 &#39;Those who know who know the Kelly &#34;legend&#34; &amp; are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt\&#39;s character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema\&#39;s best Ned (not hard considering the previous Ned\&#39;s include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger &amp; former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes &amp; Ballarat.&#39;,
 &#39;Have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: Like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house? Or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert? Yeah. Imagine stretching that image to a whole movie, you pretty much got the idea of Broken, though there\&#39;s no detectives in this movie, I\&#39;m just using it as a visual example. But, the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99% of the screen time. I got nothing to complain about that woman, she\&#39;s a perfect choice for this role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and I can truly enjoy some really moody stuff. It would be really cool if I can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let\&#39;s be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the problem of this movie. Beyond the mood, there\&#39;s not much anything else here. The director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth. I don\&#39;t consider it to be a spoiler if I say the obsession is &#34;mirror&#34;. Let\&#39;s face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that\&#39;s all the director got to work with. Granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there. If you paid any attention, nothing is going to surprise you in the end, obvious plot holes aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I\&#39;m not picking bones with this style of art since I enjoyed them most of the time. I still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express. Movie is not a piece of music, or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. It\&#39;s all that plus a good story and character development. I consider the Lynch style of movie making cheating. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. Therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not completely Lynch style, thank goodness. It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. It does not have much story or character development. It presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface. It does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it. The oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. Maybe the coherency remains in director\&#39;s head but from what I can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where did he put his effort in then? It seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music. The music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease. Only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I felt like: OK, I know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension? It is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that just took placed. Disappointing but I guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows.&#39;,
 &#34;The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. If I&#39;m to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.&#34;,
 &#39;If asked how I would define the word &#34; Shallow &#34; I would reply &#34; Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production &#34; . If asked how I would define the phrase &#34; Wasted potential &#34; I would reply &#34; Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production &#34; . Bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . Off the top of my head I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting a lot of critical acclaim . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRIMSON TIDE too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . The problem I had is the scenario that sets up the story : The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of Russia leading to an ultra nationalist Russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere . Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing . It`s not helped by some errors in geography like the French carrier Foch being in the Med ( Wouldn`t the Foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans , the first gulf war and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective &#34; Very unconvincing &#34; crept into my mind . The story does improve somewhat when the story proper - A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . Director Tony Scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . The worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means CRIMSON TIDE has little impact .&#39;,
 &#39;I first read the book, when I was a young teenager, then saw the film late one night. About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered no copies available. I then hit the web and found a site that offers War Films, soooo glad that I did, ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion to really enjoy the film I suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film. The book is no longer in print but I did track a copy down via E-bay, the Author Alan White was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the book and film authenticity. I have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film, not as good as the book. There are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also, which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch, in that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and I only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see, one of my all best war films, ever!&#39;,
 &#39;The original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any &#34;monster&#34; , it just SUGGESTED scary &#34;things&#34; , .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version however shows every aspect of a &#34;sick minded ghost&#34; , including unnecessary special effects . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;mystery &#34; ,as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened. By showing the face of the &#34;old man&#34; , this Mister has completely disappeared. Even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original&#39;,
 &#34;I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone. It holds absolutely NONE of the originals super charm! It seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don&#39;t)Sing-a-longs to the characterization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I remember the character&#39;s telling a story through a song, this film&#39;s soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn&#39;t seem to fit. Jaq&#39;s transformation into a human is a prime example: Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there&#39;s old barn dance type country music. It&#39;s as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly didn&#39;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 isn&#39;t up to scratch with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella&#39;s hoop skirt, which doesn&#39;t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie itself could have been it&#39;s own story, I think that it should have been just that. I wouldn&#39;t say that I hate it, but I believe that it had many shortcomings. It seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original.&#34;,
 &#34;I just watched The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken Friday night film, some gore, some style, bit of humour and suchlike. I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much. It seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record I&#39;m not even a huge fan of Night of the Demons, but there were some things I really dug about it. The Convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much. Apart from the main girl (likeable performance from Joanna Canton), the goth girl and a sweet cameo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable, festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic, offensive jockhood. The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that, given the awful dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film. The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes, though not scary their certainly kinda cool, and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy. The stylised direction also occasionally yields good results, although sometimes the camera just moves too fast. All in all, this was a film where for me the shining good points just can&#39;t make up for the things I hated. Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more, but for me it wasn&#39;t a good time.&#34;,
 &#39;- A film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old, supposedly cursed house where over the years, seven people have mysteriously died. One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie. It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using. But as the book is read, the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes. For the first 60 of those minutes, nothing happens. Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie. Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting? We already know that their movie isn\&#39;t &#34;real&#34;. These scares just don\&#39;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses. The acting is atrocious. Most of these &#34;actors&#34; would have trouble making a elementary school play. The score is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, other than a few moments at the end of the movie, there is none to speak of. Character logic is all but non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I don\&#39;t think I remember one scene where a character didn\&#39;t choose the most illogical avenue available to them. And finally, there\&#39;s those first 60 minutes of the movie that I\&#39;ve already mentioned. Can you say BORING? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I haven\&#39;t rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie (probably by accident) actually works. My two favorite are the beginning and ending. The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie. And, the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective (what a ringing endorsement). Overall though, these moments aren\&#39;t enough to make this a good movie.&#39;,
 &#39;The accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) is feeling bored with his routine life, limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his teenager\&#39;s daughter. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every Wednesdays night. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret. Meanwhile, Masako feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei is having an affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just finished watching &#34;Shall We Dansu?&#34; and I really loved it. What a lovely and delightful movie! The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and graciousness of the wife of the director Masayuki Suo and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On last September 06th, I saw the American remake of &#34;Shall We Dansu?&#34; for the first time, and I found it a delightful entertainment. But now I can say that it is another unnecessary remake, and I recommend this original film instead. My vote is ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Dança Comigo?&#34; (&#34;Dance With Me?&#34;)&#39;,
 &#34;This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romance on the High Seas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story line is more or less same but is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip. While Rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour. They ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in Bombay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the trip, Govinda mistakes another girl for Sanjiv&#39;s wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing Rani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings. They are pitted against each other for the warring couple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling. The comedy is slap-stick and will not make one laugh too much.&#34;,
 &#34;Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality. It has Camp Councellor Angela(Pamela Anderson..awful as the killer;her quips when she wastes people aren&#39;t even amusing)on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior. We run the gamut of boring, clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove, a kid who gets a chainsaw, one girl who gets drilled, one who gets shoved into the crapper(filled with leeches), one who is roasted, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time. That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen&#39;s(who plays the slut Ally)tits. Most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy.&#34;,
 &#34;Ossessione&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luchino Visconti&#39;s debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti&#39;s compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it&#39;s incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.&#34;,
 &#39;Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale. There was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was. To this day we still rate movies, even very bad ones, by how much better than &#34;The Lonely Lady&#34; they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screenplays for, among other things, &#34;Last Summer&#34; and &#34;Diary of a Mad Housewife,&#34; and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins\&#39; book &#34;The Lonely Lady.&#34; She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn\&#39;t think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. She then said &#34;I think they got someone else to write it.&#34; The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981, and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result.&#39;,
 &#39;Practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play Evel Knieval than Hamilton is Anthony Perkins, yet somehow Hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal (and as producer of the film, he wasn\&#39;t likely to be fired or told he wasn\&#39;t right for the part!) The early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks. The film opens with a rather silly prologue with Hamilton in his white-leather, star-spangled gear spouting the world according to Knieval as if to say, &#34;Don\&#39;t worry. This film is about my youth, but I\&#39;ll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture.&#34; Hamilton is preparing for a huge jump, yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife Lyon both supports and derides him. He recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity. This flip-flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed, but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters. Hamilton, usually a suave and debonair persona, does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject\&#39;s mannerisms and demeanor including his walk. His hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking. (He even pays minor tribute to Knieval\&#39;s many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in &#34;scars&#34; from the multitudinous accidents.) Facially, he looks nothing like the real cyclist, but he does suggest him in his physical performance. Lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife, though her 3-pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment. She and Hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over. Other nice supporting turns are given by Freed as his jaded doctor, Cameron as an early influence and Taylor as a flea-bitten sideshow barker. The film was made on a low budget, but the story is a rather low rent one anyway, so that doesn\&#39;t affect it too badly. The makers wisely used actual Butte, Montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance. Several of Hamilton\&#39;s antics are amusing, though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people\&#39;s property! Some of the real Knieval\&#39;s completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage, one of which features a mind-boggling &#34;splatter&#34; in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll. Hamilton\&#39;s then-wife (Stewart) appears briefly as a nurse.&#39;,
 &#34;When i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply moved. Everyone i have encountered, I have recommended this movie to. No one has come back saying it was bad. Busy, also did a great job with her role in this film. I don&#39;t know much about her acting career but wow, they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning it was a little slow. But after she went to the hospital....wow, the movie picks up again. i have no idea why this movie hasn&#39;t been spoken of in the movie world. My wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more...because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half.&#34;,
 &#39;I\&#39;m a pretty old dude, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a kid was fresh. I wish I have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker, so that I could taste those things today. This magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how I\&#39;ve drifted, physically and otherwise, a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations. Over the half century, they would have had to adjust quite a bit, because you see I would have known that I set them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of self and past, and story, and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\&#39;t have enough sense to do that with original Coke. And I couldn\&#39;t have invented one of those magical psychic lockers \x97 not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I really tuned into Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure \x97 you know, movies smuggled out of the Soviet block. Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women, one, and then deciding that they would be the last to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\&#39;s what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and set it aside. I did not watch it. I deferred until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I would test myself, my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it. There probably are few Poles who have worked at this, practicing to deserve Chopin. Working to deserve womanness when I see it. Trying to get the inners from the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out. I already knew that I was already past the time when this would work optimally, because I had already seen and understood &#34;9th Gate.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not know this, it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (about whom the story is named) jumped out the window, to die later after this man (played by Polanski) visits. What happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman. We are fooled into believing that he is merely mad. But the way we follow him, he is not. He merely has flashes that the world is normal, and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story hardly matters. What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years. Its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all \x97 at all except a redhead wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know of no one else that could do this, this sketch that remains a sketch, this horror that remains natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand the genius of this, you have to know one of the greatest films ever made; &#34;Rear Window.&#34; The genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out. In Rear Window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything else was fiction, woven as we watched. Here, the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker. We know this. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know it is true that bodies shift identity, that times shift, that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror, on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ted\&#39;s Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.&#39;,
 &#34;Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he&#39;s about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child&#39;s popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it&#39;s box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains Murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best!, seriously!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {Charles Dance so English i could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10&#34;,
 &#34;I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. That has been done in great detail already, many times over. The &#39;plot&#39; started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles. Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason I went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second &#39;heavy&#39; in the pub scene. It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan&#39;s face in the bar in &#39;Russia&#39; (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras&#39; agency and this was his first part. Having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD, I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets. This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.&#34;,
 &#34;Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star trek a lot of the time it actually can&#39;t be because it is completely different. I am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV so if i want to see it I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). However this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive. So in summery I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).&#34;,
 &#34;A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you&#39;re looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely you&#39;re movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I&#39;d highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I&#39;m missing something.. I just can&#39;t believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, the first &#34;Howling&#34; was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into &#34;An American Werewolf in London&#34; hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude\&#39;s ear\&#39;s started bleeding.&#39;,
 &#34;Nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? I really liked this movie because I remember when I first saw it in junior high. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it&#39;s a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80&#39;s headbanger crowd.&#34;,
 &#39;Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the original Matrix a great deal. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburne\&#39;s attempts to philosophize, but it was fairly well paced, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson. By day, corporate drone, and by night, brave hacker. Eventually, he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine, or does he go back to the safe, forgettable world he started in. Interestingly, he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions, life rather sucks. He has his girl by his side and his boon companions, but he eats processed swill, dresses in sweats, and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery. Still, the truth makes him free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the &#34;what if it were me&#34; questions raised in the viewer\&#39;s mind. What if _I_ were capable of the impossible? What if I were &#34;The One&#34;. It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of, with a cool title like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as merciless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie, and it does so with such lack of gusto, such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I cannot believe they had planned these changes. When the dialog is at a fifth grade level, with various long words dropped in randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My short list of characterization failures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oracle goes from mildly helpful, if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major &#34;personalities&#34; of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster, for example, was a cute idea, but just not that interesting a character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fishburne loses his &#34;advisor&#34; role, and gets nothing to replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Zion are not particularly likable, nor would you really _want_ them running the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special effects problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable. In The Matrix, you felt Neo could lose, and that he had to become something greater in order to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight on the freeway looked quite fake, and not that interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacing problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were interminable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people pictured, nor did we care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever hack wrote the creator\&#39;s soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business. It meandered, used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a pacing killer. The creator\&#39;s speech could have been done in a tenth the time, and with more peril as &#34;Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix. There are now too many people who do not believe; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it. Further, the earth cannot support even the people in Zion, let alone these others. You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion, while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, we got a long, drawn out bunch of twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript, and try breaking down the sentences. Each one is too long by several clauses, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, not worth seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the third one, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were &#34;deep&#34; should go see some truly deep movies. Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and perhaps a bit of philosophy. This movie is just not hard to understand, but it is hard to stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott&#39;,
 &#34;I hope she can keep acting and directing. She&#39;s surely up to the task and could easily develop that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art. Her work has a rare kind of generosity and her timing is spot-on! Oy I&#39;m kvell&#34;,
 &#39;I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, I\&#39;m very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. Kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold), and to whoever composed the music. The warped &#34;Row Your Boat&#34; blew me away. Very creative film all around....I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because I\&#39;d buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this film.&#39;,
 &#34;A confused mess from start to finish. Like they used to say about the Beatles&#39;songs, there was a secret message if you played the LP backward. If one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start, you&#39;d come away with the same degree of disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were the movie backers, out for revenge if the movie didn&#39;t get sorted. There was nothing to like about these two either. Overacting, shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion. I think one dimensional was an overstatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them, we plebeians just didn&#39;t get it. Well I&#39;m afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish. A non-existent and pathetic story line if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, not a single character you cared about in the least.&#34;,
 &#34;You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed. That&#39;s why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. We live on a tiny island, and I cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100% tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. Not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these movies are relatively easy to make. Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. For once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, can&#39;t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. Of course there are amongst us (ahem) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects (otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame), however, they don&#39;t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park. The guy sitting beside me, I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s) appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. With the Fast and the Furious franchise, the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage, as does the GT. Here, the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification, that even I&#39;m impressed, alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos, Porshe Carerra GTs, Koenigsegg CCXs, and every car out there that has wings for doors. But seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they&#39;re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. I mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no story in Redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties (the cars that is) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals (always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect), steering wheels, gear shifts (always shifting up and not down), all these while having the actors make pretend that they&#39;re the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks. Not a very tall order for an actor, and that&#39;s why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heroine (yes, it made a statement that girls can drive) Natasha (a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don&#39;t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable (every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides). Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous (Eddie Griffin), she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. Everything else, well like I said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#39;s almost always the same, as there&#39;s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged (for narrative reasons) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors, and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker, Sun Kang, and of course, the star it created - Vin Diesel, Redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it&#39;s one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action. Strictly for the car fans, or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines.&#34;,
 &#39;A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a &#34;happily&#34; married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sex fiend. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja\&#39;s role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat &#34;F.&#34; As it is, it rates an F+, implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. &#34;Diary of a Sex Addict&#34; falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes that one hadn\&#39;t.&#39;,
 &#39;Life Begins - and ends - in a typical 1930\&#39;s maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree, and Gloria Shea, as they await to give birth. While the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace\&#39;s (Loretta Young) husband. What an actor! As a first time father, Jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table. I felt his every concern keenly. I\&#39;d like to see more of this actor\&#39;s work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used to unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In that film Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who screamed &#34;Don\&#39;t cut! Don\&#39;t cut!&#34; as Scarlett fled the hospital in horror. Chilling! Another great performance is from Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse. Her character is a salt of the earth type, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loretta Young did another superb acting job here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance as Grace. My, she is great in these precodes, I\&#39;ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenda Farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste (didn\&#39;t anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies\&#39; health?) but her character redeems herself in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland, silent movie star, as a grieving Italian husband. His screen time was brief, but notable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life Begins is a must-see precode, try to catch it sometime on TCM, but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into. 9 out of 10.&#39;,
 &#34;I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films, and this only deepened an interest, as I just had to see what made this movie so bad.Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers. Although I will say it does make for curious viewing, the acting, direction, and script are so laughingly bad, that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation, the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he licks and leers at the screen, he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he&#39;s doing there. Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, Myra&#39;s alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But , of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west. The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film. I don&#39;t mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film, no one comes out looking good. The direction seems so unassured and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but boring as well. Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this, and I was glad I at least saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning.&#34;,
 &#39;In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in that film made some sense; a TV reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth. She ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live TV. The special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don\&#39;t get any better in this one. Whether it\&#39;s the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot line isn\&#39;t all that bad; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. This won\&#39;t destroy all werewolves and it really doesn\&#39;t end the threat from werewolves as it...they just want to kill her. I think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film &#34;ends&#34; we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some Devo-esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes this movie even watchable is Christopher Lee.&#39;,
 &#34;.... this movie basks too much in its own innocence. It doesn&#39;t tell a story; it&#39;s more a big time snooze fest. While the actors are all personable, the story is so trite and goes nowhere. I think Victor Rasuk has great charisma, but deserves a real film from a real storyteller.&#34;,
 &#39;Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments. He chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution. They can have whatever the want in the room (within reason), but they can\&#39;t leave. after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100. After some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they can\&#39;t sleep. One day a \&#39;witch\&#39; come into their cell (albeit a glassed off portion) What happens next I\&#39;ll let you find out. I may be in the minority here but I liked the build up, it was intriguing to me. Now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was I would have rated this so much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: C+ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media Blaster\&#39;s 2 DVD set Extras: Disc 1) Director\&#39;s Cut; Trailers for &#34;Versus&#34;, &#34;Aragami&#34;, &#34;Attack the Gas Station&#34;, and &#34;Deadly Outlaw Rekka&#34; Disc 2) Theatrical Cut; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Cast and crew interview; Making of; Original Trailer; and Promo Teasers&#39;,
 &#34;admittedly, I first picked up Ranma 1/2 when I was around twelve. I was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read. Then, I went to the Comic/Manga section and spotted this book. At my first few reads through the chapters I didn&#39;t really know what was going on, but I knew that I LOVED it. I even took it home for a few more reads over. Frankly, I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere. And then, about five months (I&#39;m 16 now) ago my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this Manga. I couldn&#39;t remember what it was called, but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi, creator of Inu Yasha. I Googled it, and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes. At first I was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics, but it didn&#39;t really matter in the end. No anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind, watch again. I once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day. I don&#39;t know how I did it... but I couldn&#39;t stop. Eventually, after about two days, I grew obsessed. I even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching Ranma. Never have I found a series so enjoyable, so funny, and so heartwarming to watch. To this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied. Of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers, but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranma 1/2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his dad Genma Saotome. INTENSE martial artists. They are so intense, that they went to the ancient training grounds in China and became &#39;cursed&#39;. The grounds were full of different pools of springs, and if you land in one, you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water. For Genma, that was a PANDA, and for Ranma that was a... girl! It&#39;s a very crafty fun loving story. On top of that, Genma promises his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the Tendo dojo alive. &#39;Course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual. Obviously they start to like one another, but both way to stubborn to admit it. But.. Genma has a history of doing this. He promised Ranma to many girls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me. It&#39;s worth watching. It&#39;s humorous, heartwarming and all around amazing.&#34;,
 &#34;This is no art-house film, it&#39;s mainstream entertainment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot&#39;s of beautiful people, t&amp;a, and action. I found it very entertaining. It&#39;s not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it&#39;s a fun film to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny too, which is just gravy. Definitely worth a rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, I&#39;d recommend checking it out for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The villains are good too. Vinnie, Corey Large, the hatian guy from Heroes. Very nasty villains.&#34;,
 &#39;I only rented this movie because of promises of William Dafoe, and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that upon seeing RR\&#39;s name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would of made so if He\&#39;s going to lend his name to it, than it has to be good right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. By far the worst editing since &#34;Manos Hands of fate&#34;. The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this film, maybe they owed somebody, but they are way to good for this. Besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and Rodriguez didn\&#39;t even talk. So if you wanna see a movie with Poor editing, poor acting, and confusing storyline than be my guest but don\&#39;t say you weren\&#39;t warned.&#39;,
 &#39;Now, I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the fact it\&#39;s a spoof, but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing, acting and dialogue. Seriously, this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one at that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume its a heart attack), the army then launch shells, rockets, bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away, and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez, those things have a range of no more than 30 metres! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling; the monster drops the kid, and the soldiers don\&#39;t try to shoot the monster??? come on! (4) the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five &#34;good guys&#34; (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general just runs away, time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn\&#39;t listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did I mention the rubber suit monster???? (10) that god-awful music, non-stop!&#39;,
 &#34;In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered Depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are arguably classics of their genre but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to it&#39;s pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of one last box office smash. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size. Busby Berkeley&#39;s dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again. Gentility and morality made sure of it.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie is one of those &#34;WOW!&#34; movies. Not because it\&#39;s the greatest movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a T.V. movie, but it was on Elvis. I can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel came extremely close to being the real thing. It was one of the greatest impersonations that I have ever seen. He had me believing that it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis\&#39; life from watching this movie. And don\&#39;t led the television part of it let you stray-it\&#39;s actually a really fantastic film! And Kurt Russel could\&#39;ve been Elvis\&#39; twin :)&#39;,
 &#34;I watched this film because I&#39;m a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking it out. She was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can&#39;t believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being &#39;beautiful&#39; didnt get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. Hopefully, Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I wouldnt do much better with that film.&#34;,
 &#39;Return To the Lost World was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of The Lost World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel, the same five people, lead by Challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land. Gomez has something to do with this. They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the natives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like in The Lost World, what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner reprise their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are also back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed Return to the Lost World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 3 stars out of 5.&#39;,
 &#39;Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While watching &#34;Bang&#34; one night on TV, I found myself bored by the nonsensical, random plot which was occurring on screen. The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless, artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director/writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.&#39;,
 &#34;This is the worst film I have ever seen.I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there wasn&#39;t a single likeable character.I could get more entertainment watching static. I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn&#39;t go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.&#34;,
 &#34;I have seen the movie Holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? Louis Sachar thats who. Although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. For example Caveman/Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. Weight wise and height wise but ZigZag/Ricky was taller and Armpit/Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray/Rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn&#39;t. The only thing that I didn&#39;t like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. I would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. I especially like the work of the boys though. Like Squid/Alan who was played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. Jake M.Smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in Holes. So I would say if you havent seen Holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you&#39;ll be missing out on a whole lotta fun.&#34;,
 &#39;After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire, with wooden acting, lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing, one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies, sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie, all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid.&#39;,
 &#39;The movie is just plain fun....maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of &#34;The Ramones&#34; around the time the film was made. I\&#39;ve watched the film over and over, by myself and with friends, and it is still fresh and funny. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, the film has some gem lines/scenes.....references to how our &#34;permanent record&#34; in high school will follow us through life. (Let me assure you I\&#39;ve been out of high school for, uhhh, some years and it\&#39;s not following me).....the famous &#34;static&#34; line (&#34;I\&#39;m getting some static&#34;.....&#34;Not as much as you\&#39;re going to get&#34;, as Principal Togar approaches).....the school board member who is so decrepit he\&#39;s attended by nurses....the Nazi Hall Monitors love for a &#34;body search&#34; ......Principal Togar announcing, &#34;I give you the final solution&#34;, and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD\&#39;s) ....and of course Joey Ramone noting, &#34;Things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school&#34;, followed by Togar asking &#34;Do your parents know you\&#39;re Ramones?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one piece of advice.....don\&#39;t look up where the stars are now.....Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who was a major hottie in the film, today reminds us we all age....PJ Soles career never advanced as we might have expected......... Marla Rosenfield, as one the other students, apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film), though I submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles. And, does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, watch and enjoy.....don\&#39;t think....just have FUN!&#39;,
 &#39;Add to the list of caricatures: a Southern preacher and &#34;congregation,&#34; a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), a dancing chorus, and The Mills Brothers -- it only makes it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contemptible burlesques of &#34;Negro&#34; performers, who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race. Though the &#34;Negro comedy&#34; may have been accepted in its day, it\&#39;s extremely offensive today, and I doubt that it was ever funny. Though I wouldn\&#39;t have been offended, I don\&#39;t think that I\&#39;d have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, however, I might not have understood some of it.&#39;,
 &#34;I loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact. While I like when a episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the uncovering of the murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interplay between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lt. Columbo, making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detective&#39;s real life fame as a crime-solver. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.&#34;,
 &#39;I love Jamie Foxx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I walked out of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing (&#34;Oh no, Jamie\&#39;s knocking on a door! HEE HEE HEE!&#34;), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point, it\&#39;s just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you\&#39;ve heard before, and too many &#34;tough guy&#34; lines... and I don\&#39;t mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there\&#39;s a bit of originality to it. In fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he\&#39;s really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave it a 2.&#39;,
 &#39;Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. Hence, when they discover women or &#34;female creatures&#34; live on Earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. However, there\&#39;s little substance underneath. As another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters\&#39; names (eg. ArmInAss); I think I laughed once at one small gay joke. I think I got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had had enough; I kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!). Not brilliant or particularly well-written.&#39;,
 &#34;This movie is by far the cutest I have seen in a long time! Wonderful animation and adorable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) made this one a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those I saw it with. I still want to see it again, but haven&#39;t had time. Better than Toy Story, which was good too, but not THIS good .&#34;,
 &#39;Let\&#39;s start this review out on a positive note -- I am very glad they didn\&#39;t decide to wimp out with Tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring. Actually, creator and writer of this episode David Chase did quite the opposite. We don\&#39;t actually know if Tony will live or die. He\&#39;s in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none. This episode seemed to move very slow, and the coma induced dream Tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed Asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely, flat-out weird. After 45-minutes I got a little sick of everyone grieving, but that shouldn\&#39; t be a reason to slam this episode. It was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still well-written and intense. Edie Falco gave an astounding career-defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband\&#39;s could-be demise. I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, which AJ most likely won\&#39;t have the balls to pull off. Silvio is now acting-boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes. There were a lot of great quips in this episode, also, and I think Vito \&#39;Pole-Smoker\&#39; Spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy S.O.B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn\&#39;t a great episode and disappointed only because even though Tony kills people, we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show. This was a necessary episode for the series, even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion. Kudos to Edie Falco\&#39;s performance, and David Chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist. This is the only season of \&#39;The Sopranos\&#39; where I haven\&#39;t a f*cking clue where it is going to go. I can\&#39;t wait for next week\&#39;s episode. My Rating: 7.5/10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Line of the Episode: (Paulie to AJ): &#34;Let\&#39;s go, Van Helsing!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrific. the plot makes no sense at all. The title &#34;cold vengeance&#34; in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable. I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap.&#39;,
 &#39;Not the worst movie I\&#39;ve seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this &#34;Phantom&#34; guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie but more how it\&#39;s perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don\&#39;t appear to have much money and have dreams of getting &#34;better guns&#34;. Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the &#34;professionals&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie WOULDN\&#39;T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn\&#39;t give a real perception what paintball is. To be honest real paintball isn\&#39;t all buddy like, it\&#39;s a lot of cussing and bonus balling not &#34;respect&#34; and playing by the rules. Don\&#39;t watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming &#34;4 is 1!!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;WOW. One of the greatest movies I have EVER - EVER seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely LOVED it! Before the opening credits were done I was glued to the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a Sci-Fi thriller - AND edge of your seat Whodunnit. Incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish&#39;d it would never end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Liu is a throwaway role. Anyone could have played it. The lead actor, Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie appeals to me who loved War Games, Sneakers, and Track Down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8-22-06. Walt D in LV&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Moonstruck&#34; is one of the best films ever. I own that film on DVD! The movie deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend\&#39;s (Danny Aiello) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I\&#39;m glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed &#34;Fiddler On The Roof&#34;) is fantastic. &#34;Moonstruck&#34; is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 stars!&#39;,
 &#39;This film should have been only 10 minutes. I mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing (I even hesitate to call it a movie). The opening credits of the film was somehow promising. As the film begins by short comments of the man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from Cohen\&#39;s life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen\&#39;s famous songs. The length of Cave\&#39;s performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already tickled your fancy. But as it turns out Cave\&#39;s performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who don\&#39;t even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat. I mean what does the filmmaker really think? five-minute close-up shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in Australia!!! What does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding &#34;fake applause&#34; to these endless nasty performances. The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is not a single footage of Cohen\&#39;s past. In fact, except for a few photographs of his early days as a singer/poet there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between disastrous camera-work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming Cohen\&#39;s lyrics. If you ever decided to waste your money on this film, DON\&#39;T! just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time.&#39;,
 &#34;Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved \x96 this move felt like a bad date. Worse, the tedious art-school direction -- with a heavy-handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up \x96- is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue, and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in. It gets worse: instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-overs AND quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters. Really loud opera music too. Blame it all on the director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors are all quite good. The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom. He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however, and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn job. The stunning college campus architecture as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. How come universities in the US are so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this film. You&#39;ll want to use the fast scan button \x96 a lot.&#34;,
 &#39;I thought &#34;The River of Souls&#34; was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I\&#39;ve always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although granted JMS didn\&#39;t write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the Byron/Telepath plot. If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the &#34;poorer&#34; actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favourite of the four movies, but in no means bad at all.&#39;,
 &#39;After apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss, Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, III, is assigned the task of taking the killer back to Italy. On the way, however, the plane is diverted to Malta. Not long after landing, the killer escapes. Now, and with little help from the Maltese police, Deputy Sheriff Geronimo is out to recapture a murderer. But will his &#34;shoot first, take names later&#34; brand of Texas justice work in a foreign country? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get this out right up front, I\&#39;ve seen Final Justice both with and without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary. I\&#39;ve seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole. And I\&#39;ve seen the cut-up TV version that was used for MST3K. Having said that, I\&#39;ve got to admit that I much prefer the MST3K version. Why? Because Final Justice is one lousy movie. The MST3K commentary helps make it much more palatable. On its own, it\&#39;s a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue (often delivered with such thick Italian accents that it\&#39;s impossible to understand), bad acting, weak direction, gigantic plot holes, and most everything else you\&#39;ll find in a bad movie. And if most of Final Justice wasn\&#39;t &#34;so bad, it\&#39;s good&#34;, it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else. So, yes, I enjoy the often very funny MST3K commentary over the bad movie on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main sticking points with the MST3K commentary and with most of the reviews I\&#39;ve read on Final Justice, however, involve the criticisms of Joe Don Baker. The main weaknesses in Baker\&#39;s performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction. Instead, I think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place. Joe Don Baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor, but he\&#39;s not the kind of guy I would call an &#34;action hero&#34; by any stretch of the imagination. He\&#39;s more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of James Bond movies. Or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with Final Justice, point your finger at director Greydon Clark. Clark\&#39;s resume can\&#39;t begin to compare with Baker\&#39;s. So I say, &#34;Lay off Joe Don Baker!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and, yes, it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad.&#34;,
 &#34;The movie actually has a fairly good story, but gets bogged down in several key places. It&#39;s almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a fairly decent job in his role... but something is clearly missing from several key scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie. And probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#34;The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you, but then, as it diverges more and more from the book, taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches, it becomes boring. Still, from comments I&#39;ve heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins&#39; Uncle Albert (I love to Laugh). Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny.&#34;,
 &#39;***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Juggernaut is a British made &#34;thriller&#34; released in the US by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to retreat to France and start up a medical practice. He is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows Karloff needs the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband. All the while, the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed. When he spills the beans to the wife, she goes berserk and even bites the son\&#39;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Karloff\&#39;s nurse has misplaced the hypo Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out he isn\&#39;t getting any money, he asks the wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. Analysis shows poison, but not quite in time as Karloff kidnaps the nurse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by Karloff. Karloff instead injects himself and dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie does have some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man Who Lived Again. It is peculiar, however, to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over. We never find out why he is walking this way. I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible. She has a French accent. Even though she overacts badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the audio is a bit choppy.&#39;,
 &#34;I have to start off by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. It&#39;s mostly because of Brad Pitt&#39;s performance. Spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting by all involved was quite good but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I&#39;m not a giant Pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutal,Honest,Gritty. All good words to describe this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early&#39;s violence isn&#39;t explained. It is explained but they thankfully don&#39;t have to go into graphic detail to get their point across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Underrated.&#34;,
 &#34;From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her?! The show not the same as before. Its way worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can&#39;t replace someone from the beginning! That is like South Park without Kyle or Child&#39;s Play without Chucky! It&#39;s not right! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Awful. She doesn&#39;t fit into the storyline at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece can&#39;t replace her. She was an awesome actress. Way better than the niece. Get her back, or you&#39;ll lose a TON of viewers.&#34;,
 &#39;Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty\&#39;s Heaven Can Wait (itself a remake of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time, before he can realize his dreams, and his adventures in his new (albeit temporary) body. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then-Los Angeles Rams. In Rock\&#39;s hipper version, our lead character is a struggling young - and decidedly low-talent - standup comedian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s very funny to see the razor-sharp Rock playing a bad comedian. It\&#39;s kind of like seeing Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton\&#39;s dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries out his material, he\&#39;s booed off the stage lustily - so much so that his nickname becomes &#34;Booie.&#34; His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock isn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lance is also a bike messenger, and he\&#39;s riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when BAM! He\&#39;s hit by a truck. Ok, so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to get hit anyway. No dice, it appears Lance isn\&#39;t due in Heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the &#34;manager&#34; of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not-quite-dead Mr. Barton. Trouble is, the body they find is of a greedy, old white man. Turns out this fella (a Mr. Wellington) owns all kinds of things - he\&#39;s the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course, while in the body of the affluent Mr. Wellington, Lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker (Regina King). We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body, but try winning one over while you\&#39;re an dumpy, old white guy! And it\&#39;s even worse when she\&#39;s not impressed by your money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Rock\&#39;s first shot at a lead role, and in my opinion he performs admirably. There\&#39;s still a lot of the standup comedian in him - and, of course, if he ever wants to get diverse roles, he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script - but this isn\&#39;t really a bad thing. Rock\&#39;s personality - his drive, his delivery, his demeanor, and his passion - are what fuel this film. He\&#39;s clearly having a lot of fun in the role, and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him.&#39;,
 &#39;WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should care. Also, sorry for the caps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that\&#39;s all the more annoying for talking nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. That\&#39;s badly but accurately put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know space travel is a risky enterprise. There\&#39;s a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms etc, and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew stuff could go wrong. In fact, stuff had gone wrong. It\&#39;s called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 wasn\&#39;t safe by today\&#39;s standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assorted mistakes/comments I hadn\&#39;t even to look up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That\&#39;s what I would\&#39;ve done. It was the apex of a propaganda war, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up. (This is &#34;only&#34; implicit, though.) Yeah, that\&#39;s why they let people and press watch in almost-real-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The capsule ejection wouldn\&#39;t work. Like it didn\&#39;t work the time a chimp was in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There\&#39;s a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) One interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of Florida. I can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole, \&#39;cause if not, I\&#39;m just aghast how he could get it so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The technology then was primitive compared to today\&#39;s standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today, the reason being that it must not crash. It\&#39;s even worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren\&#39;t that susceptible to radiation. (And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2\&#39;s wouldn\&#39;t do.) What\&#39;s with the fact that they were using &#34;TV screens&#34; rather than &#34;computer screens&#34;? It\&#39;s the same damn technology. Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) &#34;If that object wasn\&#39;t part of the rocket, it could be only one thing.&#34; We see where this is going. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it wasn\&#39;t a rocket part? At least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don\&#39;t know what it is, it\&#39;s by definition an Unidentified Flying Object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) The voice-over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander\&#39;s radiation foil was actually its hull. Which would make it thinner than a space suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Neil Armstrong\&#39;s near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate; I hadn\&#39;t seen it before. As I said, any piece of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it\&#39;s not been tested sufficiently on account of being, you know, unprecedented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9)The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the Moon\&#39;s density) was at no time acutely life-threatening. Neither was the &#34;fifteen seconds of fuel left&#34;, which was, in fact, &#34;fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) A &#34;catastrophic chain of events&#34; usually results in catastrophe. I really don\&#39;t know how to put it any simpler. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11) There\&#39;s a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid, followed by the voice-over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior &#34;can now be revealed&#34;. Turns out, he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12) It\&#39;s mentioned that during re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it\&#39;s impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but very purposely so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13) There was never a shuttle lost in space itself, while the voice-over presents this &#34;fact&#34; as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was a near-loss, but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14) What the hell\&#39;s up with the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history, science, or rhetorics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure. Catch-phrases like &#34;covered up until now&#34;, &#34;publically revealed here for the first time&#34;, come up, but the film doesn\&#39;t place any blame or offer a lesson or anything, which could be expected of a film so emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except &#34;NASA scientist&#34;. Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, which point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate, it\&#39;s not even good entertainment. And believe me, I\&#39;m a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries; this film isn\&#39;t funny, witty, quaint, it\&#39;s nothing.&#39;,
 &#39;My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie would have to be at least worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up on it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was, for me, impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is England when no one talks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters, which is why we threw in the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that Hawks directed this, as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Hawksian rat-a-tat delivery. So save your time, and skip this one.&#39;,
 &#34;Basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action/comedy. First of all I&#39;d like to say that I did enjoy the Wayans brother Scary Movie (1) and the sequel had it&#39;s moments. Unfortunately white chicks doesn&#39;t even deliver HALF the laughs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The humour in it is absolutely crude. If you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. When it isn&#39;t crude it&#39;s idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have bothered). The story is undeniably thin, it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant. I think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film, the laughs don&#39;t come quick enough. Some jokes are dragged out too long when they&#39;re more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this. If you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie, airplane, hotshots 1 + 2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10 Completely unfunny, Thin storyline, A film that seems to be based on one idea (i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film?) but simply didn&#39;t have enough material.&#34;,
 &#34;Sure, if you ask any mom who&#39;s the most beautiful baby in the world, she&#39;d tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world. She&#39;s right, at least in her own world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producers of the movie were biggie&#39;s mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, do I need to say more? I&#39;ll break it down for those who doesn&#39;t want to do a simple deduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole movie was fake. You may just put a few biggie&#39;s MTV video together and call it a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie&#39;s mother. The real one in life looks like a dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wonder why he called himself biggie small. Big body Small dick? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat Small eyes? Disclaimer: I&#39;m a person of color. So keep your racist remark to yourself.&#34;,
 &#34;How has this piece of crap stayed on TV this long? It&#39;s terrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. It&#39;s so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie. I&#39;d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. I remember watching it when it first came out. I thought, hey this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they&#39;re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.&#34;,
 &#34;OK, if you&#39;re a woman who&#39;s got aggression issues, you might like this movie. Hate your significant other? This movie is for you. For the guys, it will be a bag of laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only really good part is the last 10 seconds. Even that was a load of cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is picking the worst movies lately. This is what you get (I) for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites.&#34;,
 &#34;In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,&#39; directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell. The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite. A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd&#39;s generation is suddenly obsolete. What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he&#39;s done before. And he&#39;s given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum). Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `Soldier&#39; reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. It&#39;s an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn&#39;t make a whole lot of difference. Much like `1984,&#39; and `Mad Max,&#39; this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share. I rate this one 7/10.&#34;,
 &#34;This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I&#39;ve seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren&#39;t so stale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will end up in the Dead Movie Office soon.&#34;,
 &#39;If one would see a René Clair film with the kind of distracted semi-attention which is the rule in TV watching - one might be better off doing something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching &#34;Le Million&#34; with all attention focused upon what takes place before eyes and ears will reveal a wealth of delightful details which keep this musical comedy going from the beginning to the end with its explosion of joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende a journalist once wrote: &#34;In my younger days I saw a film which made me feel like dancing all the way home from the cinema. This film is on TV tonight - see it!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;OK, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pity the fools who still think so... Its absolute rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is just ... ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise, im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean and others, are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this film, and well, maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could&#39;ve. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may&#39;ve been good for its time, but, really, its drivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must&#39;ve just been hype about Dean&#39;s death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.&#34;,
 &#39;I was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of &#34;Girlfight&#34;. It\&#39;s an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good, but not this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placed in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-do-day struggles of urban Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers, getting in trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who appears to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based double standard on his children. The father\&#39;s double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny doesn\&#39;t like boxing, so he and Diana trade places; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a feel-good movie, as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues head-on. There\&#39;s no giggly, \&#39;everything that can go right does go right\&#39; resolution a la &#34;Bend It Like Beckham&#34;. The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, &#34;Girlfight&#34; is a better and more satisfying film for it.&#39;,
 &#34;Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s it, folks. The sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness (flared trousers, big hair, Zapata moustaches etc.). This one isn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title, hinting at a sex comedy, is grossly misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague.&#34;,
 &#39;Based on the Korean legend, unknown creatures will return and devastate the planet. Reporter Ethan Kendrick is called in to investigate the matter, and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl, stricken with a mysterious illness, named Sarah is suppose to help him.

Written by Anonymous I think he should have included the following&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst movie i have ever seen the best actor in the whole thing was the CG dragon and overall it s u c k-ed i am p i s s-ed at not only with the people who made it but myself for watching save yourself the time read a book or something maybe a little Dr Seuss that should be more stimulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no wonder the guy is anonymous sorry for the format this site has a lot of rules this is the only way i could get this out without adding more&#39;,
 &#34;This is a terrible remake of a marginal, but well liked, movie from the early 70&#39;s. I have seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie &#39;crammed&#39; into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is. Cheesy storyline, which by the way, is completely different than the original. The major government involvement was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. It takes many times longer than that in real life. Car guys notice this stuff. Also, the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. The fact they aren&#39;t &#39;car people&#39; is painfully obvious, and their passing will not be grieved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors lacked any emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but surely not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). That is total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof?? Hahahaha!! This movie is a joke. Don&#39;t waste your time watching this one.&#34;,
 &#39;WOW! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is the best living testament, I think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in NYC, compared to anything shown by the major media outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with a focus on a rookie New York fireman, waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight. The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS. You are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene, into the lobby of Tower One. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane, and Tower Two\&#39;s subsequent fall, you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby. It is a sight you will not soon forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heart-rending, tear-jerking, and very compelling from the first minute to the last, &#34;9/11&#34; deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
 &#39;Dieter Bohlen, Germany\&#39;s notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like &#34;You\&#39;re my heart, you\&#39;re my soul&#34; felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. He didn\&#39;t deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of &#34;American Idol&#34; - especially his unforgettable comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned &#34;Idol&#34; TV show called &#34;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&#34; (abbreviated DSDS) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. The result is &#34;Dieter - der Film&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really hits the point. Naddel\&#39;s voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona\&#39;s voice should have done that more. Obvious, childish, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen\&#39;s sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success. With the &#34;friendly&#34; help of Germany\&#39;s biggest yellow press newspaper &#34;BILD&#34; and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show &#34;Wetten dass... ?&#34; is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore: 2/10&#39;,
 &#39;Need a lesson in pure, abject failure?? Look no further than &#34;Wizards of the Lost Kingdom&#34;, an abysmal, dirt-poor, disgrace of a flick. As we all know, decent moovies tend to sprout horrible, horrible offspring: &#34;Halloween&#34; begat many, many bad 80\&#39;s slasher flicks; &#34;Mad Max&#34; begat many, many bad 80\&#39;s &#34;futuristic wasteland fantasy&#34; flicks; and &#34;Conan the Barbarian&#34; begat a whole slew of terrible, horrible, incredibly bad 80\&#39;s sword-and-sorcery flicks. &#34;Wizards of the Lost Kingdom&#34; scrapes the bottom of that 80\&#39;s barrel, in a way that\&#39;s truly insulting to barrels. A young runt named Simon recaptured his &#34;good kingdom&#34; from an evil sorcerer with the help of a mangy rug, a garden gnome, a topless bimbo mermaid, and a tired-looking, pudgy Bo Svenson. Svenson(&#34;North Dallas Forty&#34;, &#34;Inglorious Bastards&#34;, &#34;Delta Force&#34;), a long-time b-moovie muscleman, looks barely able to swing his aluminum foil sword. However, he manages to defeat the forces of evil, which consist of the evil sorcerer, &#34;Shurka&#34;, and his army of badly costumed monsters, giants, and midgets. At one point, a paper mache bat on a string attacks, but is eaten by a 1/2 hidden sock puppet, pitifully presented as some sort of dragon. The beginning of the film consists of what can only politely be described as bits of scenes scooped up from the cutting-room floor of udder bad moovies, stitched together in the vain hope of setting the scene for the film, and over-earnestly narrated by some guy who never appears again. Words cannot properly convey the jaw-dropping cheapness of this film; the producers probably spent moore moolah feeding Svenson\&#39;s ever expanding gullet than on the cheesy fx of this flick. And we\&#39;re talkin\&#39; Brie here, folks... :=8P Director Hector Olivera(&#34;Barbarian Queen&#34;) presents this mish-mash in a hopelessly confused, confuddled, and cliched manner, destroying any possible hint of clear, linear storytelling. The acting is dreadful, the production levels below shoe-string, and the plot is one tired cliche after another paraded before our weary eyes. That they actually made a sequel(!!!) makes the MooCow\&#39;s brain whirl. James Horner\&#39;s(&#34;Braveheart&#34;, &#34;Titanic&#34;,&#34;The Rock&#34;) cheesy moosic from &#34;Battle Beyond the Stars&#34; was lifted, screaming and kicking, and mercilessly grafted onto this turkey - bet this one doesn\&#39;t pop up on his resume. Folks, you gotta see this to believe it. The MooCow says as a cheapo rent when there is NOTHING else to watch, well, it\&#39;s moore fun than watching dust bunnies mate. Barely. :=8P&#39;,
 &#34;It is a good film for kids who love dogs. It runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog. The bird talks like a human(Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It is the comedy that the film needed more of. See it in the matinee so you don&#39;t have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.&#34;,
 &#34;This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it&#39;s a period piece, the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale. Ward Bond&#39;s portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-staged and highly effective. That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must.&#34;,
 &#34;well its official. they have just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. I mean the story is about two college fraternity&#39;s who battle each other for its houses, I mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know its hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but so no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best character in this movie of course is Jim&#39;s dad i don&#39;t know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.&#34;,
 &#39;You already know how painful to watch this movie is. But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars. Why the cars should be not only the victim of violation, but also the only true actors and performers in it. So how on Earth you Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions.Stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests. It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back !!!&#39;,
 &#34;Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world&#39;s great directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well that writer&#39;s dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his finest performance (I am usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is brilliant as well. Well worth seeing.&#34;,
 &#34;I saw this film in its premier week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun. I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc, but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I read (and still own) all of the Bantam books, I started going to comic book cons (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5. Philip Jose Farmer&#39;s Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase. In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the 30&#39;s were short and if one looked at Lester Dent&#39;s (AKA Kenneth Robeson) outline for writing them, they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors (guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film) who all acquit themselves very well. Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest have fallen off the map sadly. I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful. I would say 0 but I give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction (Doc&#39;s answering machine at the end was a nice touch) and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun.&#34;,
 &#39;This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film, THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero. However, due to far superior modern technology, puppets and CGI are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd. However, give it a chance. Don\&#39;t think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways, this is exactly the sort of advice I\&#39;d give to adults who watch Miyazaki\&#39;s SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and features tons of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big differences between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child-friendly. While I do think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was intended mostly as a kids\&#39; movie, in the USA, most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it\&#39;s so violent, scary and features some adult behaviors. So who is the audience in the West? Well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and composition. This is a rather narrow audience, indeed! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you are watching, look for all the strange little touches. In fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time. A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about Gamera, the scene that came with the comment &#34;KIDS: Don\&#39;t Try This At Home&#34; as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, director Takashi Miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories I\&#39;ve seen have seemed &#34;normal&#34;. Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films I\&#39;ve ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS). One thing for sure, it\&#39;s hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other.&#39;,
 &#34;I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t able to excite, really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that didn&#39;t redeem it. I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director/writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate&#39;s part, it may have worked - Jeremy&#39;s acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it. Such a shame. Disappointing.&#34;,
 &#39;There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its best.&#39;,
 &#39;Jack Black\&#39;s character, Tim Dingman the &#34;Dreamer&#34; in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray &#34;Vapoorize&#34; that when sprayed on doggie dung, makes the poo disappear into thin air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so that I could spray it on this &#34;stinker&#34; of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Envy is not the worst movie that I have seen in the past 12 months (that honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it does get the honor of a close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not funny, not sad, not anything. A real &#34;Stinkeroo&#34;!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 0.2 out of 10!!&#39;,
 &#39;The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw &#34;24&#34;. The speed things are happening is amazing, and it\&#39;s so surprising, thrilling, and even interesting, it\&#39;s almost as if you are reading a book; once you start it, it\&#39;s very hard to stop. From the minute Richard Walsh was talking privately to Jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside CTU, I was sitting 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes!!! (Sounds funny and crazy, but I\&#39;m the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can\&#39;t stop)This series is one of the best of it\&#39;s kind. And it\&#39;s build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together. Recommended in every way!&#39;,
 &#39;The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it\&#39;s perfection on film. It\&#39;s a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction &#34;WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE\x85&#34; But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I\&#39;m pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares\x85 pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her mother dies and her sister evicts her, Nell receives a phone call, telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor. Upon arrival, Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and &#34;bad sleeper&#34; Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrow\&#39;s true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain, Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to fill it with a large family full of children, however all of Crain\&#39;s children died during birth. Crain\&#39;s wife killed herself before the house was finished, and Crain became a recluse. The first night, Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house, including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words &#34;Welcome Home, Eleanor&#34;, and becomes extremely distraught, setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain\&#39;s cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house\&#39;s fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she\&#39;s crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this film, it\&#39;s really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her look, just everything about her, don\&#39;t get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn\&#39;t fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized, I just can\&#39;t believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid of something, be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid\x85. Oh, this film is already hurting me, just don\&#39;t see it, it\&#39;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10&#39;,
 &#34;James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a Budapest gift shop who don&#39;t really like each other, not knowing they&#39;re really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very charming romantic comedy, very engagingly played by it&#39;s two likable stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (don&#39;t quite know how to explain it) that films today just don&#39;t have. This can obviously be compared to the recent You&#39;ve Got Mail, and the original wins in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is mandatory viewing each Christmas, I can&#39;t think of a better way to jumpstart a Christmas feel than this little gem.&#34;,
 &#39;I so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it went completely the other way - let\&#39;s be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it. I bet One Small Seed went nuts for this. I know SL did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off. Even Danny K had better timing. I\&#39;m actually being serious. Every time they introduced a bit character I kept thinking, &#34;Darn, this person should have been the lead!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent doesn\&#39;t mean that the camera work needs to be horrible. Black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief. The black and white also wasn\&#39;t crisp. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Strangely enough I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe that\&#39;s why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Corne (who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything) was speaking to this movie and not David - see it and you\&#39;ll understand. I bet the guys who organise Oppikoppi were dismayed. One would think nothing happens there at all. I got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone\&#39;s back garden. I know regular guys who have much funnier, raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these &#34;comics&#34;. The dude who they hooked up with end was OK though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess SA comedy\&#39;s gonna stay in the stone age a little longer. Nice work guys.&#39;,
 &#34;Flat, soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are going to come in, which are always at the wrong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character, Spirit the horse, is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening. The narration is not needed, though, as everything happening is really obvious. You can even tell what the horses are saying, although all they do is neigh. Which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses&#39; voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young kids might like this film, though. It&#39;s soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there&#39;s little danger of anyone being frightened. If you have nothing else to do, and want to watch a film with your kids, this isn&#39;t a bad choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, this isn&#39;t recommended.&#34;,
 &#34;I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni&#39;s passing with numerous unwatched films of his that I own on VHS; however, given my ongoing light-hearted Christmas marathon, I had to make do with just this one! As it happens, it features one of his best performances - and he was justly Oscar-nominated for it (with the film itself being likewise honored). This was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely-recognized star to emerge from Italy, Sophia Loren; both, incidentally, are playing against type here - she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the film&#39;s title has a double meaning: the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage), but it more specifically refers to the stars&#39; &#39;brief encounter&#39; in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, briefly, passion - though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to the film&#39;s abrupt bittersweet ending. This is virtually a two-hander (with all other characters - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety - which include Loren&#39;s gruff and fervently patriotic husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, appear only at the beginning and closing sequences); still, the cramped setting doesn&#39;t deter director Scola (for the record, this is the 7th film of his that I&#39;ve watched and own 3 more on VHS) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result - though essentially low-key - is far from stagy: the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building, observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires, but always keenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing, and they both deliver (their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable); it&#39;s interesting, however, that while Loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf, it&#39;s Mastroianni&#39;s moving yet unsentimental outsider (the film, somewhat dubiously, does seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti-Fascism!) who generally impressed international audiences!&#34;,
 &#39;Just as Tom Berenger put you into the soul of Sgt. Barnes, he has done it again with Thomas Beckett. If I thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes, it was nothing compared to how much more I felt during the last scenes. Great movie, even for a girl.&#39;,
 &#39;I first saw Thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I guess. As any kid would be, I was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first viewing. I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years. In addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at his very best. When you see Thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time. When you see Thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece. It`s as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas McCarthy&#39;,
 &#39;It appears that there\&#39;s no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it\&#39;s often foolish and illogical. It\&#39;s also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeanette\&#39;s deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then &#34;Aloha Oe&#34; on the beach! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove.&#39;,
 &#39;This is a gorgeous movie visually. The images of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the characters in their picturesque costumes...all amount to a real work of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story seems a bit loose, but that\&#39;s because it\&#39;s not meant to be realistic. It is taken from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude, and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated, otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America &#34;so far from God, and so close to the United States&#34;. The tremendous debt that Erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of Latin America\&#39;s international debt burden, although there many layers of meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can appreciate a slow-moving, richly-textured movie, this one is for you.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve seen this film several times in a variety of short-film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a school-film is very well produced and directed, but the story... well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed some in-dept approach. This is something that lacks in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still... i liked this movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens! (congratulations!)&#34;,
 &#39;Ronald Colman plays a famous Broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity. After years of playing a wide range of parts, he can\&#39;t remember who he exactly is--who are his roles and who is the self. And, much more serious, he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life. So, since he\&#39;s currently playing in &#34;Othello&#34;, he begins to act jealous and suspicious--just like the title character. Ultimately, it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this film years ago and liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because I have always liked Ronald Colman and this is a great triumph for him--and for which he earned the Best Actor Oscar. And, looking at the competition that year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMAN\&#39;S AGREEMENT, John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL, William Powell for LIFE WITH FATHER and Michael Redgrave for MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA), I think Colman was a very good choice, as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated Shakespeare--and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him. However, this film isn\&#39;t really about Shakespeare, and it doesn\&#39;t matter at all if you dislike Shakespeare. I am no huge fan of Shakespeare, but marveled at the small portions of the play that Colman re-enacted--though, as I said, this is NOT a really movie about Shakespeare. Instead, it\&#39;s a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality. It could have been ANY play, though &#34;Othello&#34; was an excellent choice because of the murder scene--which gets acted out for real later in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very clever film due to a lovely script--with some overtones of Film Noir. Fortunately, the acting was terrific also, as Colman had excellent support from Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O\&#39;Brien (who was particularly good--he played his part just right). And, considering the great George Cukor was directing, it\&#39;s no wonder it\&#39;s a wonderful film from start to finish.&#39;,
 &#34;A bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my...this is one of the movies, which doesn&#39;t have even one positive effect. Just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky. I just wonder how low I.Q. you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Is there something than this is worth watching for? Well, there is a lot of nudity involved, but it&#39;s nothing particular. And when you just think that it couldn&#39;t get worse, your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old. C&#39;mon guys, where did you search for these actresses. In elderly home, perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, the leading actresses has some sex-appeal and knows how to show it. Again, too bad, that she is too skinny &amp; old. All in all, skip these one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 out of 10&#34;,
 &#34;when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, cast specially Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film,very intelligence and interesting because ,cast have a lot of international specially European actor and actress like from Turkey and Russsia...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second,Story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you&#39;ll like in my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third,Final chapter is not special or interesting,it&#39;s regular like other action movies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally,i recommend to watch this movie...And i hope You&#39;ll love it enjoy :D&#34;,
 &#39;This (extremely)low-budget movie is compared to the great classic &#34;Silent Night Deadly Night&#34;, since it is labeled as a Slasher Flick. First let me say that I think that even &#34;Silent Night Part 2&#34; is better than this (that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). &#34;Christmas Evil&#34; tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane,(a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can\&#39;t stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love. Dressed up as Santa he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. For one exception that is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic &#34;The Green Mile&#34;. He still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role. He truly is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main lead. (who also isn\&#39;t that bad, but if you\&#39;re overshadowed by a little supporting character, you\&#39;re not great either.). And what about that strange ending ? (you have to see it, to believe it). &#34;Christmas Evil&#34; is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You wanna see a real Christmas slasher, check out the all time greatest: &#34;Silent Night, Deadly Night&#34;.&#39;,
 &#34;Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie), and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn&#39;t for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role, and it&#39;s too bad for Hamill that he didn&#39;t take a few acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo.&#34;,
 &#34;If you see this turkey listed in your TV guide, AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn&#39;t begin to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one funny scene (the memory eraser scene) but even that rates only .001 on the laughometer (out of 1000). Whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives.&#34;,
 &#39;This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER, I emphasize, EVER made. What´s worse, my old hero Dolph is in it and he´s starring it. Jesus... The story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt. The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter. The actors, except for Dolph who kinda sucks also, perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director, who by the way must have been absent most, if not all, of the time. This is §12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because by the look of the effects and scenery, the cost can´t be a cent above §1000.&#39;,
 &#34;in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn&#39;t even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there&#39;s the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don&#39;t even remember...she was that forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media minions who can&#39;t critique efficiently (you know, the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stay away...far away. and shame on comedy central, where i saw this film. they usually pick better.&#34;,
 &#39;-Kidnappings in Mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you\&#39;re rich then you\&#39;ll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe. A couple hires a washed up bodyguard called Creasy to protect their adorable kid Pita. At first, their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while, Creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship. One day Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is badly injured in the process. When he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets Creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Keep some Tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it. I really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right. The only problem is the annoying visual style, which will either make you hate the movie or hate Tony Scott. I really feel sorry for the cinematographer because I\&#39;m sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the DP for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it\&#39;s been possessed by demons. I wouldn\&#39;t have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it\&#39;s spread through out the whole movie then that\&#39;s when we have some problems. The same annoying style was recently used on &#34;Domino&#34; and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Another person I feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great Harry Gregson Williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images. Somehow, Williams wrote some decent music for the movie but I\&#39;m sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better. The sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience, it rather makes you feel like you\&#39;re being punished. The overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it. I don\&#39;t know why Scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals. Little Fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart. If the end of the movie doesn\&#39;t make anyone cry then they\&#39;re dead on the inside. Denzel Washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily, for him he gets to play a great character. The whole idea of a man that\&#39;s lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but Washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character. I love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge. Radha Mitchell plays Marc Anthony\&#39;s wife and she along with Fanning are the two reasons why I can\&#39;t hate the movie too much. J.Lo\&#39;s husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn\&#39;t really stand out much. Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-One thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray Mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie. A little too late for that if you ask me. Let\&#39;s hope that Tony Scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him CAN and must do better than this.&#39;,
 &#34;This is a ripsnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that by today&#39;s political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable. But this moving isn&#39;t about politics. It&#39;s about action, dialogue, comradery, acting, direction, music, and photography, and it&#39;s marvelous on all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks, and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is superb. This is the ultimate buddy movie.&#34;,
 &#39;*****Spoilers herein*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe. But those fears don\&#39;t even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one\&#39;s own child. &#34;Pet Sematary&#34; taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. The acting is actually first rate for a film like this. Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the film\&#39;s events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of &#34;Pet Sematary&#34;: It isn\&#39;t that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite warning, or even past history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. And the results are horrifying. In fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it\&#39;s almost a letdown, although I believe it\&#39;s perfectly logical how it got there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a true horror fan, and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. If you don\&#39;t think so, see it again after you have children.&#39;,
 &#34;Visually stunning and full of Eastern Philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films Hong Kong cinema has produced. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons. If thinking is not your forte, however, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go see the latest from the Hollywood studio&#39;s no brain club, but if you are looking for something more, he&#39;s where you will find it.&#34;,
 &#39;Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home, and from Marion\&#39;s double-edged &#34;Well that\&#39;s that&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s now 1950: reunion time. The gang\&#39;s all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted, and as thought-provoking and moving, as the original series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. From Marion\&#39;s family to Joss\&#39;s health centre, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trip to Dominica\&#39;s plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. There\&#39;s a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, once again, fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colours, and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lush location filming in Singapore, and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It\&#39;s such a shame that this really is the end. I could watch it all over again. Perfection.&#39;,
 &#34;This really is the worst film I have ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid £3.50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie. Incredibly dull, poorly acted, dire script, often incoherent and too many scenes that don&#39;t seem to have any relevance to the overall film (like when Heath Ledger&#39;s priest partner get&#39;s nailed to a wall by a ghost...what was the point in that scene? answers on a postcard please...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it&#39;s entire running time. I would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be cast into IMDb&#39;s bottom 100. Hopefully my vote of 1/10 will help it on it&#39;s way.&#34;,
 &#39;I simply love this movie. It is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising stories that come out of Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply awful Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was aghast when I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version and who was starring in it. It\&#39;s typical Hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it\&#39;s worst. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon. The ONLY reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the US audience\&#39;s aversion to subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons this movie would never work in an American telling is that the reserved, ultra socially conservative character of the public Japanese persona is at issue in this movie. Certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance, but half of the movie\&#39;s tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try to see this movie in it\&#39;s original form, not the terrible full screen. And please DO skip the US remake....it\&#39;s a shallow travesty in comparison to the original Japanese movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know the &#34;original&#34; movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new US remake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of foreign films, I\&#39;ll make a few quick recommendations: 1.Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, outstanding film! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic! 3.Shiri-A Korean action pic that mixes both Asian flare &amp; US style plot 4.Run Lola Run-A German film that integrates it\&#39;s techno score ingeniously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, just a quick list anyway :-)&#39;,
 &#39;Wow... I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story\&#39;s I\&#39;ve ever had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and his son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And 16 year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, thats just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn\&#39;t enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for &#34;stealling&#34; their loved ones. And speaking of loved ones, I\&#39;ve lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been his fiancée, Akane. And thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so... so... out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable... I can\&#39;t even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story thats so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humor. Not once have I laughed out loud this much from a manga, and it doesn\&#39;t have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson\&#39;s or something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to end. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo... with every little problem the story throws at him he\&#39;s doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to ever live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever he does have some spotlight... he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad ever from an anime? You haven\&#39;t met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma\&#39;s greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to Ranma)... and probably one of the only people he can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault... is his lack of sense in direction! Then we have... you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story\&#39;s, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the series if you haven\&#39;t, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I\&#39;ve had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humor doesn\&#39;t seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10!&#39;,
 &#39;Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be &#34;Who?&#34; or perhaps &#34;Why?&#34; Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, which is about a poor, desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for &#34;carfare&#34; to the United States. It\&#39;s an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well-meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks. The movie takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland, all Mr. McLaglen\&#39;s character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk. The movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they don\&#39;t even know what the fuss is all about. The morale of this movie is: look out for the friend, he may sell you out for a dime.&#39;,
 &#39;As a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and the stand alone feature BSG Razor I was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. Usually I have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little CGI money spent. This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous &amp; unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens don\&#39;t love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex &amp; violence &amp; heavy dance music. Its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth &amp; reason or political &amp; religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. But this old concept was far better portrayed &amp; much more believable in the brilliant, classic original &#34;Frankenstein&#34; with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! Overall this movie was bland &amp; unoriginal &amp; cheap looking, using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG. I doubt I\&#39;ll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure. Zzzzzzzz&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;d have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a &#34;Lifetime&#34; presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether &#34;set&#34; there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site, it\&#39;s this movie. Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. It\&#39;s also been done pretty often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I\&#39;ve seen. I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday, at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. I\&#39;d never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna\&#39;s mother) whom I\&#39;d seen in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie\&#39;s best friend) who was outstanding as &#34;Gramma,&#34; the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from &#34;Rounders.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chance meeting and coupling between both leads\&#39; best friends, as a sub-story romance, with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact, it enhances it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checking some other comments, I agree completely with those which are the most positive. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love films with a &#34;harder edge:&#34; &#34;Rounders;&#34; the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; &#34;Goodfellows;&#34; even the classics like &#34;Casablanca,&#34; &#34;Gone With the Wind,&#34; &#34;Citizen Kane.&#34; But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by &#34;You\&#39;ve Got Mail&#34; and &#34;Sleepless in Seattle.&#34; And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn\&#39;t have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films, as well.&#39;,
 &#34;I am watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel that the TV was turned to when I turned it on. It is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister&#39;s wife (Alexandra Paul) falling in lust with a young stud/drifter (with washboard abs) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey whips his shirt off a lot and Alexandra swoons. I&#39;m getting the feeling he&#39;s supposed to be up to no good, and that&#39;s why he&#39;s messing with skinny Alexandra Paul. It&#39;s not really important because as I said he takes his shirt off a lot and I just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage. There&#39;s a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful.&#34;,
 &#39;Does anything at all happen in this movie. There are only the bizarre short scenes where I didn\&#39;t know what the hell was going on so that doesn\&#39;t count. This movie is sooo boring it hurts, and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies. Confused?, well I was after watching this crap. What was Donald Sutherland on, because he missed it with this one completely. And what\&#39;s with the &#34;pedofile&#34; scene at the beginning of the movie. Can put anyone to sleep! 4/10&#39;,
 &#34;Wow-this one sucks. I&#39;m gonna sum it up as quickly as possible.\xa0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. Some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-The End.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few brief nudie shots. And believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. In fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. As everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there&#39;s absolutely no bloodsucking, nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. It may as well have been called &#39;The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk&#39;-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. An accurate title would have been &#39;90 Minutes of Torture&#39;-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. Honestly-the trailer that&#39;s on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term &#39;best&#39; extremely loosely...) so I highly suggest watching that instead if you&#39;re still curious. \xa0I can&#39;t imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10\xa0&#34;,
 &#34;While a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind, this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen. It predicts the global chaos of WWII, but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years, and then tells the epic tale of man&#39;s struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space. The acting seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie&#39;s release, and which still impress today. This is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the SF genre.&#34;,
 &#39;What a great Barbara Stanwyck film that I happened to see the other night. &#34;Jeopardy&#34; was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. Husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if Barbara drives back to a garage for some rope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there she runs into a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favourites) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as Barbara tries everything in her power to get Meeker to come back with her to free her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was so suspenseful and such a surprise - I was not expecting such a great film. But I suppose I should have realized - is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful?&#39;,
 &#34;This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn&#39;t just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn&#39;t enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar&#39;s success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems unlikely.&#34;,
 &#34;Perhaps the biggest waste of production time, money and the space on the video store shelf. If someone suggests you see this movie, run screaming in the other direction. Unless, of course, you&#39;re into self-abuse.&#34;,
 &#34;To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor isn&#39;t funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me, that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks. Also, the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies, other than a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one. The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls. Don&#39;t watch this movie and don&#39;t be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because it obviously overrated and doesn&#39;t deserve anything above 2.&#34;,
 &#34;Happy Go Lovely is a waste of everybody&#39;s time and talent including the audience. The lightness of the old-hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable. Very few people watched these movies for their plots. But, they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs. Not Happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie, and couldn&#39;t do it. The Scottish locale was wasted. Usually automatically ubiquitous droll Scottish whimsy is absent. The photography was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part, in the type of producer role essayed frequently by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is just fine, and no one could do David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you adore Niven as I do, it&#39;s reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t understand the low 5.7 rating on this film. It&#39;s a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics. The tone is reminiscent of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, down to the locale (Savannah). The acting is strong, and I was amazed at the verisimilitude of Kenneth Branagh&#39;s southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Great full nude scene of her,too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is fairly standard but effectively executed.&#34;,
 &#39;It was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan the original 1944 movie. That, to me and many others, is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Realizing this is simply a shortened made-for-TV film and that most people had trashed it, I didn\&#39;t expect much, but you can\&#39;t help but compare this with the \&#39;44 film. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at it, and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was all over, I found it wasn\&#39;t as bad as I had expected but it\&#39;s no match for the 1944 original. The two main areas in which this made-for-TV film wasn\&#39;t as good were (1) the electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as &#34;Walter Neff&#34; and &#34;Phyllis Dietrichson,&#34; respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this re-make held its own was in the other characters, such as &#34;Barton Keyes&#34; and &#34;Edward Norton.&#34; Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines, etc., were all early \&#39;70s instead of mid \&#39;40s. Otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film.&#39;,
 &#39;Why is it that any film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Ceasar, and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. Despite lavish sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any Italian &#34;sandals and toga&#34; extravaganza of the 50\&#39;s. Admittedly, this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen, which is why &#34;Gladiator&#34; went over well, but &#34;Gladiator&#34; did not have all the romance novel sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Pity some of it didn\&#39;t wash off on the others.&#39;,
 &#39;I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise interesting. I stuck through it, even though I found the acting, save Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I kept hoping my time spent would pay off, but in the end I was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. Maybe in George Orwell\&#39;s version there is a message worth conveying. If this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read Orwell\&#39;s classic. I find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. If the film maker\&#39;s message is &#34;the mundane life is worth living&#34;, well then, they\&#39;ve succeeded. I would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.&#39;,
 &#39;Having read the other comments on this film, I would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile. I am not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looked at by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting. It is quite difficult to watch. The Brooks character (Robert Cole) is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him---let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to the next. And he should NEVER do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like Kathryn Harrold----unless, of course, he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks-controlled production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Modern Romance&#34; has its amusing moments-----but they are fragmentary and infrequent. More often than not, I felt as if I were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already. It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person---someone who lacks the self-discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is in fact what he portrayed. Six years later, he cast Albert Brooks in the very successful &#34;Broadcast News.&#34; James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance. Albert allowed us to see James (generally not cast as an actor) do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of &#34;Modern Romance&#34; will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it. To you I say-----there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment.&#39;,
 &#39;You might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made-for from the beginning, since the credits list Susan Dey as &#34;Special Guest Star.&#34; Um, why would a one-off MOW like this have a guest star? Well, if you stick with it, you\&#39;ll find yourself paying attention to little else but Ms. Dey\&#39;s butt, wiggling in a flowered bikini as the &#34;Partridge Family&#34; house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes. Susan\&#39;s derrière is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo-disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene. Sadly, Susie and her tush fight a losing battle: the jiggle-TV craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off, so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role. In 1976 Fat Freddy Silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as Susan\&#39;s audition tape for &#34;Charlie\&#39;s Angels.&#34; As is, our Susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber, neurotic women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view beyond Susan\&#39;s heinie, it must be said, is not very compelling. The scenery is nice, and photographed in a bizarre, hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera. Nope. It\&#39;s just a typically suspense-challenged 70\&#39;s made-for-TV thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash(and collect some cable residuals, though they obviously didn\&#39;t know that at the time) and show off their &#34;range.&#34; Here we\&#39;re treated to a TV-scale nuclear family, squaring off against TV-scale thugs who can\&#39;t decide whether they\&#39;re a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult (thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies) and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television: don\&#39;t mess with Dennis Weaver (see &#34;McCloud&#34; and &#34;Duel&#34;). The only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage-son character of Steve, played by the long-forgotten (if ever-remembered) Kristoffer Tabori, who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is (supposedly) menacing his family. But Steve, as played by Tabori (gosh, why didn\&#39;t we see more from this wunderkind?), is actually just grumpy and moody and isn\&#39;t one bit conflicted when big D gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial (and literal) sand. For the sleep-deprived and Susan Deyniacs (there must be some of you out there) only.&#39;,
 &#34;That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It&#39;s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally , too.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad, too! One is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e&#39;er she goes. The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual, slightly parted lips. And, not to give anything away, she is even more bad than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three sisters are played by starlets. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever marketed. Well, of course not the first but the raciest at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls wear as little as possible and let&#39;s not forget about the female audience members: Bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor -- whose fetish was this? -- bare-chested. He also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a real plot here, too: The girls&#39; family, see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide -- or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is not bad. I truly don&#39;t know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. The women are scantily dressed. They often resemble lurid covers of mags like Police Detective or jackets of dime novels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the guy seems to be the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is meant to also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s lots of fun -- and on its own terms, too.&#34;,
 &#34;One of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that restore one&#39;s faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A unit of Australian underwater demolitions experts are captured in an archipelago near Japan following a successful mission to set mines in a Japanese harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other POWs but to their dismay soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured. The consequences of such an infraction, by Japanese martial code, is execution by beheading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their pleas, and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guard, the day of reckoning approaches like a ticking time bomb. The tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here. But I can promise you-- you&#39;ll never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the U.S.&#34;,
 &#34;A couple(Janet and Richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house. Soon, a pair of escaped convicts show up and, after much delaying of the inevitable, they proceed to rape Janet and lock Richard in a birdcage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made. It&#39;s one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers. Moreover, I found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it&#39;s perverse tone. I love CAGED TERROR. The music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty. I found the film to be quite creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film, which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering. While I didn&#39;t mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question, I do think that it will both most people. The acting isn&#39;t too good nor is the dialogue, at least in the early scenes. This film takes a little more patience than usual, and it&#39;s really not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this was a good film. Not the greatest horror film I&#39;ve ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun. It&#39;s not exactly the easiest film to find. It&#39;s possible to find it in the USED section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough. It&#39;s not for everyone, but if you&#39;re a fan of trash cinema then it&#39;s definitely worth checking out.&#34;,
 &#39;This film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts. Average montage scenes, 30-somethings playing teenagers, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the &#34;new-wave&#34; of modern classics. As a viewer, I came away from the film with the same sense of &#34;shock and awe&#34; as when I first saw The Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner\&#39;s startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt Judy was deserving of her Grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the Godfather series which got better with each installment, and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.&#39;,
 &#39;Back to the roots with &#34;like it is in heaven&#34; - what are the real values of life? These Swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart. We\&#39;ve seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat: love pure and joy within the music of a choir that\&#39;s simple, yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple, warm and rough people of the North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved unconditionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t go see it if you\&#39;ve been normed to Hollywood. This stuff contains no extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!&#39;,
 &#34;This is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it really is something else. It doesn&#39;t try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#39;t talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, yet we don&#39;t appreciate it one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie should be shown obligatory in schools. It is the most wonderful film you will ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, but I would easily rate it more if it were possible.&#34;,
 &#39;Those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on. This is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and, of course, the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit dull, but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie. Also, they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing. I first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it. I was not disappointed.&#39;,
 &#34;In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious &#39;space-dust&#39;) has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his family&#39;s recently acquired domesticated zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal&#39;s collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido&#39;s trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole &#39;reanimated dead&#39; theme that I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connelly&#39;s Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead&#39;s Bub, and Return Of The Living Dead&#39;s Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin&#39;s performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K&#39;Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentions\x97Ray, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.&#34;,
 &#34;Legend of Zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty. This movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. The acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think you&#39;d keep more to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic. The plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air. Legend of Zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. Allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.&#34;,
 &#34;Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $25million. His uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold-diggers. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women. We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman. At the end, love is in the air for Bill and one other .............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film. The story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers isn&#39;t that good either. He&#39;s pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone. There is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is just dull.&#34;,
 &#39;I am very unpolitically correct guy, so when I say sexist I really mean it reduced the female guest lead, Dr Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control, to nothing more inside but a big, jealous unreasonable baby You prolly got the plot by now, after her technical sidekick Marvik, also a spurned lover, flips out when he tried to kill the Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, out of a jealous rage, but glimpsed first it instead. (You think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box, too easy) he takes the Enterprise into un-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor-liaison and discussed it. &#34;Spock has to make a mind meld with the Medusan so we can get home. I mean like beetch do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die?&#34; But the lady in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monsters who whines and wails when the idea is broached, even when her Medusan idol told her to shut up &amp; go along with them. So the beetch out of spite messes with the melded Spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes Spock go insane. Kirk, naturally, figured out what a total twit she was and shamed her into fixing Spock up with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, at the end the Lady and Medusan leave and all is forgiven. You almost wish the President from Battle Star Galactica showed up to jettison the witch out of an airlock for her destructive stunt. But in Star Trek land, ladies are permitted to be totally unreasonable and cruel, yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.&#39;,
 &#34;We laughed our heads off. This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry) s**t on his desk. Of course this was not on a nuclear mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script. When a captain is put under arrest, he IS under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room. He CANNOT escape, it&#39;s just like in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. This is not done, ever. My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, all the rest is bulls**t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this film gets an extra dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: Thas Boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
 &#39;I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (Chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example). So this year was no different. While I\&#39;m not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me. I\&#39;ve laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even enjoyed him in Dude Where\&#39;s My Car?. But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible. Nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; he sure as hell can\&#39;t act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m curious as to who the writers were for this show. Last year\&#39;s performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremly funny (The Lord of the Rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show), but this year was completly different. Did anyone understand Timberlake\&#39;s comments regarding Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson (&#34;They\&#39;re staring in a movie together, but have never met! Here they are...&#34;) Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just went into their lame dialogue, never making a reference to the &#34;joke&#34; by Timberlake. And Seann was completly wasted as a talent, not even causing me to smile, yet alone laugh. And what was the point of Harrison Ford\&#39;s one-liners? Did they make ANY sense to anyone? Perhaps the MTV writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the President from Air Force One. I\&#39;m baffled. And would someone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old does he THINK he is? The guy looks 30, trying to act 19 again....give it up, show some class (like in your best actor academy award speech) and act your age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the speech by Gollam for Best Visual Performance. This was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening.&#39;,
 &#39;Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star-vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences, updates the hit 1978 comedy &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34; with an urban agenda. He plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body--consequently, his angels must find another body to place him in, and can only come up with that of a white businessman. Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34; only shows that Rock\&#39;s eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an Evening at the Apollo? Terrific supporting cast (including the usually-reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and terrific Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout. *1/2 from ****&#39;,
 &#39;Anyone notice that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The angry eyes look he gives every enemy. 2. The holding of the hands to face, mouth agape and frightened eyes. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that i pretty much hate this show, i don\&#39;t watch it but it\&#39;s like Code Lyoko, we\&#39;ve all watched at least one, i must say that this show is borderline racist, uninteresting and pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every episode ends with robotboy winning, except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jokes are pretty crude too, i think it\&#39;s mostly people saying the word &#34;Suck&#34; or farting, i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn\&#39;t there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate, and the other uses a chain, for god sake, what kind of school is he going to. Not to mention his older brother, who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole show i feel is ripping off megas XLR and Fosters. Like you could say the trio of coop, jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy being similar to Megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he\&#39;s free spirited despite being a robot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is simply no appeal to this show, i\&#39;m surprised that it\&#39;s still running.&#39;,
 &#39;(WARNING: minor spoilers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran into this one partway through and watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. It certainly held my attention; I didn\&#39;t know until the ending that it was based on a true story! The guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl; I have to question how true to life that portrayal is. Anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can\&#39;t be entirely nice. Still, I did have some sympathy for him, as he had been set up and taken advantage of; that much was made clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is with the ending (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you don\&#39;t want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered. The way it got discovered was in a &#34;sting&#34; operation, but my question is: how did the police get convinced to go along with it? The movie didn\&#39;t show us that, and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn\&#39;t have been there (we would already have known what the scene was about, and what was going on with Brad in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a pretty good film; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I\&#39;m interested to find out the facts of the real case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: the movie was done in 1996. Some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Meadow Sisto is lovely. I hadn\&#39;t seen her before. She can act a little, too (always a plus in her line of work, LOL).&#39;,
 &#34;Vivacious &amp; irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unlooked-for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister &amp; brother on Prince Edward Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Maud Montgomery&#39;s well-loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, a literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress Anne Shirley is a joy as the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians. Completely assured in her starring role, Miss Shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne&#39;s boundless imagination, quick temper and not-so-secret sorrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also completely commands her role; the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp-tongued woman slowly unbend to Anne&#39;s affection and child-like innocence. Australian character actor O. P. Heggie gives one of his finest performances as Westley&#39;s shy, gentle brother who welcomes Anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to fetch her from the railroad station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs Anne&#39;s attention. Sara Haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most of his few moments as Avonlea&#39;s doctor.&#34;,
 &#34;Wow I loved this movie! It is about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It is about things everybody encounters in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and &#39;what will the neighbors think&#39; more important than to follow their heart. Don&#39;t let anybody&#39;s opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. No big beauties, but all people you fall in love with during the movie.&#34;,
 &#39;I see quite a few positive reviews on this board, trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following. I see the usual ranting--&#34;I guess this movie is just not for the easily offended,&#34; &#34;This movie is not Shakespeare,&#34; etc. Guess what? Neither was &#34;Road Trip&#34;! And I laughed my a** off during that movie! There\&#39;s a way to make a crude, tasteless comedy and deliver laughs; and there\&#39;s a way to...just make it crude and tasteless. &#34;Whipped&#34; tries to be &#34;Swingers&#34; without the wit or intelligence. It seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14-year-old boy. For God\&#39;s sake, the characters in this movie are supposed to be white-collar, upright citizens--and they talk like some of the idiots I knew in freshman year of high school! The dialogue is laced--more like drowned--with four-letter words. You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence--and a more extensive vocabulary. Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you\&#39;ll see the difference. Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish. If you know any successful, white-collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie--please let me know and introduce me to them. Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty. There is absolutely NO insight into relationships, sex or...anything!!! It\&#39;s just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely--and don\&#39;t take the word &#34;extremely&#34; for granted, because I mean it with all my heart--crude gags. These are gags with no substance. Gags that are meant more for groans than laughs. The scene at the end between Amanda Peet and her girlfriends was totally un-called for and totally unconvincing. There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by (straight) men and play out wonderfully. This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures. It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman\&#39;s mouth. It was one of those noticeably-written-by-a-guy scenes. I wasn\&#39;t believing it for a second. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Whipped&#34; is purely a sick male fantasy that\&#39;s as flat as it is annoying. I got (very) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy, and those were probably a result of desperation. When you\&#39;re not laughing for a long period of time, you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things. So I wouldn\&#39;t mark that down as a positive.&#39;,
 &#34;I just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire. It&#39;s style is definitively unique and very well made. It is filmed with actual actors, but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. It&#39;s a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures. The story and mood remind of Blade Runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. The storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. This film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don&#39;t like sci-fi or b&amp;w.&#34;,
 &#39;I realize that living in the Western Plains of Wyoming during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly &#34;made-for-TV&#34; movie? Also, women\&#39;s rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era \x85 would it make for good viewing? Honestly, I don\&#39;t know. I have thought about this film for the past two days, and I still can\&#39;t seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet I can truthfully tell you that it wasn\&#39;t the greatest I have ever seen. From several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland. Was it good? Was it bad? That may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments I enjoyed and desperately hated! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes. Scenes where I wasn\&#39;t sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole. I thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale. I do not know much about living in Wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind. The thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this Polaroid-esquire view untouched by corporate America. It was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience (though the television). There were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattle-branding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didn\&#39;t survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story. Director Richard Pearce did a great job of bringing the view of Wyoming to the viewers, but I am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, I had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side. Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as Clyde Stewart, a loner that somehow finds a connection with Conchata Ferrell\&#39;s Elinore Randall. The two as actors have no chemistry at all. Their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion. The pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two &#34;veteran&#34; actors portrayed it. The brave Elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while Clyde gives an approving nod when she is done. This is love? Was it supposed to be love? I don\&#39;t know, I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with Torn and Ferrell, it felt like two actors just playing their parts. Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse &#34;knocks&#34; on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that Clyde had for Elinore\&#39;s daughter (I just didn\&#39;t believe it), the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene. The land scene especially because I needed more explanation on what Elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why Clyde would build her a house if they were married! It was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will go middle of the road with this feature. There were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of Elinore, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation. These panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers. While there were some brilliant scenes of realism (starring cattle and pigs), I just felt as if we needed more. Depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story. Pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clichéd Western characters. Ferrell carried her own, but Torn was completely miscast. Decent for a viewing, but will not be picked up again by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: ** out of *****&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Roman Troy Moronie&#34; is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is of course great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an &#34;R&#34; rating because he could not pronounce profanity.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;And All Through the House&#34; is a special crypt episode not only because it\&#39;s from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and I was buried to the Crypt right then and forever! I had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by HBO I again had fearful pleasure. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it\&#39;s just so enjoyable with a nice twist. &#34;And All Through the House&#34; has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! Well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!&#39;,
 &#39;If anybody really wants to understand Hitler, read WWI history not WWII history. Find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time. How so many soldiers went insane, from what they saw during WWI, at the time they called it &#34;shellshocked&#34; now the call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of WWI, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death, not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie unfortunately misses that, as so many others do. Read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie &#34;paths of glory&#34;, the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie, the sense of helplessness, and a utter devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullet catchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats what this movie misses, its really the key point to understanding Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, for no real reason. Then comes an utter economic collapse, following the war. Those are the factors that create extremism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism. Unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile. With really no real value, there are fictional movie\&#39;s based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of Hitler than this does. They just threw Hitlers name on this so it would sell more.&#39;,
 &#39;This reminds me of when I was a born-again believer who was going to be a minister. I never actually thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be raptured to Heaven before that would ever happen. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch rubbish. I am now an atheist, and that just proves that the &#34;once saved always saved&#34; doctorine that Christians tell us is no more real than elves. If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devout born again believer? Yes, I really was saved. I prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Christians were to read their Bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are alright according to him. They might be surprised to learn that no where is the word &#34;rapture&#34; mentioned.&#39;,
 &#34;it&#39;s all very simple. Jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con and the chess masters. they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure, and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: from his innermost fears, from what he believes to be himself. for that, they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear, all the pride, all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#39;s a clever movie about the journey of illumination, about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.&#34;,
 &#39;Miss DeCarlo\&#39;s starring debut has everything the writers could come up with -- from the Franco-Prussian War to the US Civil War, the great American West, San Francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stage coach bandits, and a Chinese junk. Just when you thought the plot couldn\&#39;t get any screwier, it does. It\&#39;s magnificent, taken tongue in cheek. DeCarlo\&#39;s character (here called Anna Marie -- NOT Salome, that\&#39;s the role she dances) is loosely based on the career of the notorious Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the King of Prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels. She did escape to the American west. There is a town in Arizona called &#34;Salome, Where She Danced,&#34; based on the historical fact that Lola Montez did dance the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate, nor I assume is the Chinese wise man with the Scottish accent -- but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and DeCarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout.&#39;,
 &#39;Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn\&#39;t have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it\&#39;s just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let\&#39;s not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone\&#39;s imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. &#34;I\&#39;ll never let go, Jack.&#34; Titanic is a great film down to it\&#39;s very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.&#39;,
 &#34;I have grown up reading Modesty Blaise, both the comics and the books, and she truly is a heroine to me. Although not being a great fan of Quentin Tarantino I anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her: could he finally give Modesty a nice big screen treatment she&#39;s worthy of? I heard of &#39;My Name Is Modesty&#39; a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here, and wasn&#39;t too surprised to find out the score was not too high, since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans&#39; heart if not done exactly right. So I decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead, and well, I just finished watching it, and I&#39;m stunned, and sad, and yeah, pretty furious, too. Sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as Modesty Blaise-character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that almost everything about this film is sub-par and unprofessional, although I must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so I can&#39;t blame them. But the screenplay and the directing... my god, why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average TV-film but done much worse? I don&#39;t know the background of this film and actually I really don&#39;t want to know, but I just can&#39;t help wondering that how on earth could Tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves Modesty and then put his name on this? He just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes. The director was not the right man for this job and I can honestly thank him for ruining my night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could&#39;ve been worse. The other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at. Oh well, hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of The Modesty Blaise Movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the Modesty fans. Although if people like Tarantino are the ones making the decisions I&#39;m not holding my breath.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie had so much potential. Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it\&#39;s ridiculous. Too much time and effort was spent in the movie on Dahmer\&#39;s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals? Instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the major point in Dahmer\&#39;s development. Also, the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh, etc. I could go on, but to sum up, too many lagging points in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is &#34;Dahmer.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;This is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that warm, fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories, but it does do the trick: Entertain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being from Sweden and living in the US for quite sometime, it is funny how we react. &#34;The deadbeat husband is going to kill him&#34;, &#34;She (Gabriella) is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking larger-than-life ending&#34;. We know how these things work, everything comes together at the end. And it did. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborate that you didn\&#39;t really think twice about it, nothing was really left for your own imagination. The closest would probably be Siv, she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with Daniel, but that\&#39;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the movie is beautiful, set in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable. Michael Nyqvist is truly genius, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe a little too nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most of all this movie makes you feel, and that is the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. I don\&#39;t know about you guys, but that does not happen that often.&#39;,
 &#34;The plot is tight. The acting is flawless. The directing, script, scenery, casting are all well done. I watch this movie frequently, though I don&#39;t know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me. See it and drop me a line if you can figure out why I like it so much.&#34;,
 &#34;This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid. Since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. The Japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior&#39;s death. Of course, under the code of Bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded. A fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared.&#34;,
 &#34;I appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film, but this is too much. In the end they look like a bunch of loonies. This film is one of those finding yourself 70&#39;s plots, I know the film is made in 1980. A lot more of Clint and girl friend movie. This movie is a 3/10.&#34;,
 &#39;This was disappointing. It started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar, it fell flat. Maria Schrader\&#39;s acting is dreadful, never seeming to mean what she says, or even knowing what she says until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion at all, not for her beloved goy, or her mother\&#39;s story. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena\&#39;s story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which isn\&#39;t much. The supposed parallel between Hannah\&#39;s &#34;mixed&#34; romance and her mother\&#39;s relationship with her father was as cliché as they come, and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to care about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatever for that.) If every reference to him was removed it wouldn\&#39;t be noticed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple story made confusing by poor character development (who was whose mother, again??) weak acting, and directing that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear &#34;quiet on the set!....&#34; I started thinking this was worthy of a 7, but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4, then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile a movie as I have seen. A terrible waste of a good story.&#39;,
 &#34;I just finished watching this movie. It wasn&#39;t ridiculously bad, but I&#39;m really disappointed with it. I&#39;m not really sure why someone would make a movie like this. It was marginally entertaining, but I feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making. Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; etc. It almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies, but only had the time and money to make one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else commented that the acting was really good, but I&#39;d have to disagree. Then again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming, perhaps they&#39;re better actors than I give them credit for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery... something along the lines of a historical Law and Order or National Treasure. It starts off like that, but then, out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or... what was that other show that wasn&#39;t as good... A bad episode of The Outer Limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out. There&#39;s the evil guy with spiked white hair. There&#39;s the love interest, who, when she first appears, the wind actually blows through her hair. Seriously. Once you realize it&#39;s a Christian movie, the end is also pretty easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography was poorly done, especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward. It wasn&#39;t atrocious for most of the movie, but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady, praying, arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie.&#34;,
 &#39;How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn\&#39;t matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of &#34;funny notion&#34; scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director/producer tried to go &#34;tear jerker&#34; at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they\&#39;re fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.&#39;,
 &#39;By God, it\&#39;s been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie tells us (kids) all about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally put together--Disney-style animation, plus human actors--it was directed by Frank Capra, for pete\&#39;s sake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of an overkill. I wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film-strip\&#39;s worth of information on the human body? But boy will those kids watching it learn: even now I can clearly remember Dr. Baxter being challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood, to which the Doctor immediately answers &#34;sea water.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident...well it must of been. blonde women being stalked,the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute\&#39;s then disappearing and reappearing,hiding.he was\&#39;nt even a super hero so i don\&#39;t know how he did it.he could\&#39;nt frighten a cat and that\&#39;s not hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the old &#34;mirror in the bathroom&#34;is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago. you had the cop on the trail of the villain,another cliché(played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent,he\&#39;s from London) the director did\&#39;nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché\&#39;s and make\&#39;s &#34;scary move&#34;which was a COMEDY look scary. pathetic!&#39;,
 &#39;Once again, I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap (I mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I wasn\&#39;t too disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. There\&#39;s no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Usually, these movies require all four of those elements. The PG rating is well-deserved--not like &#34;Sixteen Candles&#34; where the &#34;f&#34; word is used twice and there\&#39;s a brief gratuitous nude scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could\&#39;ve been developed more. The film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing at the end, but there\&#39;s so little chemistry that it seems forced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Dream Machine&#34; is no gem, but it\&#39;s good, clean entertainment. It\&#39;s quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for Haim--but it\&#39;s also much better than you\&#39;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My score: 7 (out of 10)&#39;,

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<ul>
<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>
<li>Inference Code,</li>

<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script.

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<p>In order to construct a PyTorch model using SageMaker we must provide SageMaker with a training script. We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run. When the training container is executed it will check the uploaded directory (if there is one) for a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install any required Python libraries, after which the training script will be run.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Training-the-model">(TODO) Training the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Training-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>When a PyTorch model is constructed in SageMaker, an entry point must be specified. This is the Python file which will be executed when the model is trained. Inside of the <code>train</code> directory is a file called <code>train.py</code> which has been provided and which contains most of the necessary code to train our model. The only thing that is missing is the implementation of the <code>train()</code> method which you wrote earlier in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Copy the <code>train()</code> method written above and paste it into the <code>train/train.py</code> file where required.</p>
<p>The way that SageMaker passes hyperparameters to the training script is by way of arguments. These arguments can then be parsed and used in the training script. To see how this is done take a look at the provided <code>train/train.py</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

<h3 id="Deploying-the-model">Deploying the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Deploying-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>Now that the custom inference code has been written, we will create and deploy our model. To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>Once you have copy and pasted the code above into the Lambda code editor, replace the <code>**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**</code> portion with the name of the endpoint that we deployed earlier. You can determine the name of the endpoint using the code cell below.</p>

<p>Once you have added the endpoint name to the Lambda function, click on <strong>Save</strong>. Your Lambda function is now up and running. Next we need to create a way for our web app to execute the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-API-Gateway">Setting up API Gateway<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-API-Gateway">&#182;</a></h3><p>Now that our Lambda function is set up, it is time to create a new API using API Gateway that will trigger the Lambda function we have just created.</p>
<p>Using AWS Console, navigate to <strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> and then click on <strong>Get started</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page, make sure that <strong>New API</strong> is selected and give the new api a name, for example, <code>sentiment_analysis_api</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create API</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we have created an API, however it doesn't currently do anything. What we want it to do is to trigger the Lambda function that we created earlier.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown menu and click <strong>Create Method</strong>. A new blank method will be created, select its dropdown menu and select <strong>POST</strong>, then click on the check mark beside it.</p>
<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
<p>You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text <strong>Invoke URL</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <code>website</code> folder there should be a file called <code>index.html</code>. Download the file to your computer and open that file up in a text editor of your choice. There should be a line which contains <strong>**REPLACE WITH PUBLIC API URL**</strong>. Replace this string with the url that you wrote down in the last step and then save the file.</p>
<p>Now, if you open <code>index.html</code> on your local computer, your browser will behave as a local web server and you can use the provided site to interact with your SageMaker model.</p>
<p>If you'd like to go further, you can host this html file anywhere you'd like, for example using github or hosting a static site on Amazon's S3. Once you have done this you can share the link with anyone you'd like and have them play with it too!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important Note</strong> In order for the web app to communicate with the SageMaker endpoint, the endpoint has to actually be deployed and running.
